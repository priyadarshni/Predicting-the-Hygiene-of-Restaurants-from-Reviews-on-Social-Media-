Yes I do have to admit that every once in a while I have a lapse in judgement...and go into Wendy's.  I'm not sure what the worst thing about it is.  Is it the fact that this location emanates so much dirty that even with a renovation it would seep through?  It could be the wonderful design scheme that they use in every Wendy's I for one am not a big fan of soft focus photos of cheeseburgers.  There are some people that enjoy a location like this I can barely stomach a frosty and most of their other meal options can't make it past my lips.  Saving some money isn't worth it and square burgers don't taste any better.the straight-cheap burgers and other random fast food.What's good-cheapThe  slap-horrible indigestion from eating bad food.  that's what we call karma folks.,no,,,,
Do you want to get haggled by a drunk homeless person?  Are you in Downtown Crossing and you need to use a restroom comparable to a port-a-potty?  Do you enjoy eating at dirty tables and feeling like it would be more sanitary to have your meal outside?  Is there no better restaurant smell in the world than urine?  Would you like service from people who enjoy working at this Wendy's as much as you enjoy getting teeth pulled?    THIS IS YOUR SPOT.,no,,,,
My stomach turns a little every time i think of this place. Its a place for CHEAP chinese. and i mean dirt cheap. something 6 or 7 dollars at the mall is 3.50 here. Dayum thats cheap.But sometimes things can get iffy. Super greasy sometimes and its worse when i think of the curry chicken i think it is. Ive had better but not for the price. Price is not beatable. Food could be better. The place is also barely big enough to squeeze inStop by if ur in a megafuck rush or like me a little on the broke side.,no,,,,
Quick? Yes. Oily? Yes. Dirt cheap? Also yes.What exactly do you expect paying $2 for a box of noodles? Their staples are lo mein rice noodles fried rice stir fried chicken and stir fried veggies. There's one single line that goes in one end and immediately out another door making the takeout process even faster. In terms of how the food tastes it really depends on which day you come. I've noticed there are two chefs who rotate. There's also a sriracha bottle handy on top of the counter.It's fast and MSG is yummy but eat at your own caution.,no,,,,
"Tiny simple fast easy and cheap.$2 small box $4 big box cash only. Choice of; white/fried rice Lo mein or rice noodles and 2 of what I assume is teriyaki chicken Tofu curry chicken and broccoli. Sometimes they throw in other items. I  feel as though the portions and how much of what you get is dependant upon which person is working. It isn't white meat chicken but its not bad tidy is good fresh big pieces of broccoli. Food is Always hot and does taste great especially for the price. Sometimes I just go in for the noodles and veggies and add my own chicken at home. I never paid attention to the name of this place before searching for it so I could review it. I have always recommended this place to my friends usually giving the street intersection and ""purple awning"" as my directions. I think its funny its called ding Ho restaurant it should be called ding Ho in and out because you literally walk in 3 feet get your food and walk out 5 feet all in a matter of 2-3 min if no one is in front of you. It's good fast dirt cheap Chinese and I've never felt sick after eating there which is more then I can say for some other establishments in Chinatown.",yes,,,,
First of all I'm sick of all these misplaced suburbanites dissing Downtown Crossing like it's the toughest hardest dirtiest place they have ever been to. This isn't Disneyland this is a city. There are all kinds of people and it can be dirty and diverse and you may even see a homeless person or a junkie but seriously it isn't dangerous or threatening or even close to some real tough areas b-fucking lieve me!  SO this place has the best customer service I have ever seen. You get a free falafel while you wait and the wait is minimal no matter how long the line is. The line alone speaks volumes. The falafel sandwich is awesome. The grape leaves rice everything is good. I had a lamb shank dinner once. Great! It's a take out counter so go somewhere else to eat like the Commons or Corner Mall. Really fresh food.Just be careful not to get mugged or killed.It's really scary. NOT,yes,,,,
Located inside a sketchy indoor mall more like a badly lit single corridor with a cell phone stall smoke show and cheap Chinese stall Falafel King is a popular food stall close to Downtown Crossing.  The two vertical spits were empty on Saturday.  Perhaps there are better days to go?  I wanted my shawerma to be carved/shaved off to order.  The menu includes falafel kebabs shawerma plates and wraps etc.Everyone seems to get a free falafel patty as soon as it's their turn to order.  That was nice of them.  The falafel was dense tender on the inside and dark brown and crispy on the outside.  I'm not the falafel expert that Dan B. is though. I had the chicken shawerma plate $6.95.  They give you a ton of food so it's definitely a good value: tabbouli hummus cucumbers lettuce pilaf 1 falafel patty chicken and half a pita.  The pita was paper thin and straight out of a plastic bag.  Disappointing.  The chicken pieces were dry with little flavor.  Very disappointing.  The pilaf was moist and perhaps the best thing on the plate or the falafel patty.  The tabbouli was very sour.  The hummus was average.  The super watery hot sauce wasn't spicy but it was sour too vinegar. There isn't any seating but there are some dirty looking counters inside. Technically there is one stool.,no,,,,
Hav-a-falafel Hav-a-falafel Hav-a-falafel then shut-up-a-you face....Instructions: 1 Find and enter super dirty sketchy weird pseudo food mall2 Walk past cheap nasty *insert negative adjectives* food places to find da King3 Stare longingly at falafels4 Accept free falafel from da King with a curtsy ladies or bow men....he is da King after all5 Place free falafel in your mouth masticate swallow not as dirty as it sounds6 Order7 Enjoy falafel wrap8 Do a dance and tell your friends,yes,,,,
Delicious and fresh tasting falafel wraps. The veggies were nice and crisp and the price was great for a quick bite to eat. Grab your food and head to the park that's walking distance. The place looks shady and dirty but the people are super nice and the place is quite well maintained. I can tell you I'll be back before my vacation is over that's for sure!,yes,,,,
I had the pastrami which was good. My son had the chef salad which was lame. He asked for Caesar dressing but I don't think it was. It tasted odd almost sour as in bad. When my son asked for blue cheese instead the guy looked at him with a sour puss. The place is kinda dirty too and the bathroom is nasty. Oh and they charge extra for cole slaw with your $12 sandwich. Seriously?,no,,,,
What can I say that already hasn't been said? The sandwiches were awesome the fries and slaw were good. Service was fine and things behind the counter seemed clean. The place was packed even at mid after noon but folks go where the food is very good and fast. The dining area was a little cramped and dirty due to the lunch crowd. The food while amazing is bit expensive so this is a once in awhile lunch treat.,yes,,,,
i've been to the tap abpout 3/4 times now.its a nice spot to watch a game and get some cheap drinks and food.but the service sucks. the girls that work there are total airheads and have no expierence working with customers.  they shouldnt even be working there but they are good looking. well the servers are the bartender looks nice for a while. the waitress always takes her sweet ass time to come to you. even if you have a dirty table covered with glasses and plates they will stay there till she feels like it. i was there last night and saw 4 or 5 dirty tables and people walking in and asking the bartender to have someone clean them. and the bartender totally just shrugged them off.  awful.  hire more staff during game nights and playoffs!i go there for the cheap beer$8 molson pitchers wings.25cent and the food. also  a great place to watch a game. 2 times i have had my food order messed up. you have to ask for a menu atleast 3 times for them to get it. everyone there forgets. they also take their time putting on the game when it starts. and when your done with drinks/food the bartender or server takes an hour to clean it up or get you another drink as ive stated. great place during the week for a cheap night out and to watch a game but i dont recommend on the weeeknds and the service sucks. be warned. the ditzy bartender and airhead server will drive you crazy. btw....   The Point behind bell in hand has $7 budlight pitchers during the week also with 25 cent wings.... hello point goodbye tap,no,,,,
This is the worst Bruegger's I've ever been in.It's dirty.The staff is awful.The food comes out burned thanks to the awful staff.I think I'm done for good here.,no,,,,
It's funny--somebody else's review basically says it all: his party was refused service since he was wearing shorts.  As somebody who likes to get away from endless pseudo-Irish pubs blaring NESN and Bon Jovi and from hordes of 25-year-olds in hoodies who can't have a conversation without yelling I can report that I am officially in love with Locke-Ober.It was quiet when I met my wife there at 10:30 on a Friday but despite the fact that business was on the slow side by that hour the white-dinner-jacketed bartender was fast attentive and super-friendly.  I've always been a fan of the Ward 8 but I never knew that they invented it there.  I'm pleased to report that the original is fantastic with lots of oomph and none of the cloying flavors of lesser versions that I've had.  They also have a decent dessert wine selection and I have no doubt that I'll be back down there after enjoying a porterhouse somewhere one of these nights.The thing that really put them over the top for me was that after I retrieved my topcoat from the coat check thank goodness for that--I'm always ticked-off when having put a top/trench coat over the back of a barstool part of it is left puddled on a dirty floor the bartender decided to show us the rooms that had already been closed for the evening since we had told him that this was our first visit.  Pure gilded age oppulence.  It amazes me that for generations this place is has been there with only minor changes and that it's possible to belly-up to the same bar that many of the people responsible for creating Boston as we know it once did.The above-referenced review doubts that Locke-Ober will remain successful for much longer thanks to its policy on shorts.  Nonsense.  Locke-Ober has been in business since long before grown men started wearing shorts off of the golf course and if the basic sense not to do so should ever return decades into the future I'm sure that they'll be in business still.,yes,,,,
"This place has gone downhill. As in 2 or 3 years ago I would have rated it a 4 star but I now feel firmly that it is a 2 star place. I really wish I had read the review from early 2009 that referenced problems with cleanliness standards at the restaurant. If I see even one of those reviews I usually stay the heck away. My issues with cleanliness or lack thereof are as follows: - Scollay Square has a musty kind of smell. Definitely unpleasant. - Based on the taste of the fountain drinks we were served I'd say that the machines haven't been cleaned in quite some time. If you have ever worked in food service you know that tons of bacteria build up in those fountain drink machines. - The carpet leading downstairs is old and dirty and needs to be replaced. - The musty smell downstairs is even stronger than upstairs. - The downstairs bathroom area was dirty bordering on sketchy As for the food I think that ""meh"" sums it up. I was with a friend from out of town and we both ordered the lobster mac and cheese. I found that the sauce was a little velveeta-y for my taste. I didn't say anything to my friend because I didn't want to be a downer. I was just disappointed especially when places like Figs and Ivy have such delicious versions of this dish. I will check back for yelp updates but I think that I'm pretty much staying away considering there are better options in the area.",no,,,,
I went to Al Capone's today to get a sandwich for lunch. I immediately noticed after placing my order that they had a large quantity of salad bread lying on this dirty table. Some covered some not. And due to the large number sitting there I knew this is what they are giving to customers. It was gross to see it just sitting out on a dirty table. Then I happen to notice a roach crawling up the wall as I'm waiting for my food. I could be wrong but I think we all pretty much know what those look like... Once I received my food I approached the manager - daughter of the owner. She shrugged off my concerns and all she cared about was that I was in there talking on my phone . I had to ask this woman was she serious and are customers not allowed to talk on their phones in there?! Then the owner comes over and he seemed to agree with me in being concerned however he quickly got defensive with me once I mentioned the roach I seen. Needless to say the owner snatched my sandwich out of my hand and I was basically told I can leave 'since clearly your not happy' his words. Of course I will NEVER go back there again and him snatching the sandwich not only saved me from consuming food that is likely contaminated.. but they didn't deserve to get a dime of my money. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this place. If you want a good sandwich from a CLEAN establishment and GREAT customer service.... Go to Al's on State Street. And in case your wondering yes I filed a complaint with the Inspectional Health Dept.,no,,,,
Dirty and slow At Saturday and I don't speak Spanish !!!,no,,,,
Oh yes the Wendy's in Downtown Crossing.I love Wendy's even more so than McDonald's. So I'm here as often as I can.Location: It couldn't get any better. It's right on Summer Street in Downtown Crossing a couple of doors down from CVS. You can't miss it. It's VERY T-friendly as there are several bus and subway stops very close by.Store: This store is one of these 'inner city's stores where you order and get your food downstairs and then eat upstairs in a dining room. The decor is fine its slightly run down but that's more because foot traffic this store gets. The Store is usually clean but the upstairs dining room may be dirty if its directly after a lunch or dinner rush.Selection: Typical Standard Wendy's Fare. Square Hamburgers Chicken Nuggets Fries etc. Food is always hot and always freshly made. Never an issue there.Price: Not too bad considering it's location. On par with nearby Wendy's pricing Copley & Berklee locations.Staff: I've noticed at this store the staff are actually VERY nice. And not the typical disgruntled fast food worker attitude. And its appreciated. I'm impressed by the staff at this location.Service: Since this is such a high volume store this store *has* to be fast with getting orders out. If it's busy you won't wait long for your food. Actually I've never waited long at this Wendy's for my food.I think my biggest complaint about this Wendy's is the hours. Why does this close at 6 pm?!? Geez at least stay open until 8. And my other complaint is about some of the patrons... it's downtown so fast food places have a tendency to attract the homeless and weirdos. Unfortunately there's little Wendy's can do about it except enforce it's loitering policy!Overall I'll be back. The food is hot and good and that's what matters. So I'm rating this Wendy's four stars.,yes,,,,
"Biddy Early's tops a very short list of ""best dive bars in Boston"" and is in contention for best overall in my vaunted opinion. - Open till 2- Serves cheap decent bar food- Takes credit cards- has scratch tickets and keno- golden tee- naked photo hunt- 5 TVs- a *functional* cigarette machine- $1.50 PBRs- Internet jukebox full of 80s trash/treasure- accessible by every MBTA subway line and commuter service rail boat and on an MBTA bus line- 2 man saw hangs over the bar- bartenders are quick with pints- bathrooms are small and cramped just dirty enough that you know you're in a dive bar but just clean enough that you don't feel too skeeved out by using them. And yes I've seen them both. This place is a big room full of kickass.",yes,,,,
This is the dirtiest place I've ever been. Although the bartenders were extremely nice it doesn't make up for the fact that I'm pretty sure I must have caught some sort of transmittable disease just touching my table in there.,no,,,,
Small often crowded cheap drinks dirty bathrooms. Good deals chill crowd decent bartenders good time. All the makings of a dive bar with the addition of a few arcade games in the back and especially nice atmosphere.,no,,,,
My partner and I sometimes go here for breakfast because it's close to home the food is good and everything is inexpensive. Note: I have only been here for breakfast. The service is very friendly.The food is absolutely great if you're in the mood for something down-to-earth straight-forward and slightly greasy. The pancakes are very delicious--crispy circumference and fluffy with just the right amount of chewiness maybe chewy is not the right word choice... Whatever. It's good. Just order it. I love their random paper placemats. They used to have mats with pictures of all the presidents but now they have mats with photographs of places to visit in Italy and not the top tourist spots you would expect. I love the paper plates. I love the plastic utensils neatly wrapped in paper napkins. Will keep coming back.,yes,,,,
I went here last night with a few friends. The place looked really neat when I walked in. Nice looking bar good seating plenty of beers to choose from. Service was nice enough we were in a large group at one of the tables and the waitress was quick to start me up on a separate tab I know it's a pain in the ass so it's nice when you don't get grief for it. Problem is this place is WAAAY overpriced. Sure it's close to Gov't Center but it's not like the area is THAT devoid of bars. I had two beers both locally brewed and it was $14 without tip. Some friends got a quesadilla and that looked mediocre at best despite being $10. It's too bad because it's one of the few places I've seen Wachusett on tap.,yes,,,,
Best burrito ever! Avoid the lunch crowd the line will go all the way to the door 11:30 is good 12:00 it's swamped. The atmosphere is neat and the staff is always wonderful. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. They take level up now too!,yes,,,,
I go to mulligans almost every day . The staff is funny and pleasant .the food is fresh and chicken salad to die for the girl with the brown hair is so fast and her sandwiches   are neat it's amazing I have my lunch before I pay that's what I like best good job mullihans,yes,,,,
This place was great.  I went in expecting a run down sports bar from the 50's.  But instead it was the perfect combination of sports and class.  Memorabilia everywhere but neat and tidy not just jumbled on the wall like an applebees or something.  Not to mention awesome memorabilia like the old garden hoop measuring pole mentioned in a previous review and Signed jersey's hats gloves shirts sticks balls spanning the past several decades of boston sports.I will definitely go here again.,yes,,,,
1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off2 Stars - Needs Work But fixable3 Stars - adequate4 Stars - near perfect rough edge here or there5 Stars - Can't get much BetterAmbiance: Beacon Hill Bistro is a neat little place right off the Common in Downtown Boston.  Location is great.  Very nice bar as you enter with great drinks worth a stop before you sit down for dinner.  The dining room could use some work as there is a little bit of a hotel feel not exactly what comes to mind when I think of a quaint French/American Bistro.  It is more modern and a little serious but at the same time not uptight.  If you are looking for a super romantic night out with a significant other it might be disappointing but other than that ok.  3.5 stars.Service:  Quality of service was very good.  4 stars.  Our waitress was familiar with all the items on the menu that we had questions on and provided exceptional advice on ordering dishing that fit what we were looking for.  Additionally and something I appreciated she knew when to come to the table to take our order or ask if we needed anything.  Wasn't overbearing and made us feel right at home.  The only thing she lacked was knowledge on the wines.  For this type/style of restaurant I would expect nothing more of the service nearly 5 stars.Food: 5 stars.  Now this could have been just what we ordered but two spectacular apps and two perfect entrees.  We started with the seared foie gras and the a special on the menu which was an assortment of rare field mushrooms goat cheese pomergranate seeds and shaved black truffles on top my favorite part!.  Both were fantastic and had simple flavors that were very focused you could definitely tell the chef knew how to really bring everything together just perfectly rather than trying just to do something exotic for nothing more than the sake of doing something exotic.  The entrees were fabulous.  We had the Rabbit and the Venison.  Again the chef focused on the heart of the dish and making sure to use ingredients and accents that enhance the meats rather trying to stack stuff to the moon or make some unique presentation with various rarities on the plate just to impress.We followed with a great cheese tray that was very reasonable at just $7 and a phenomenal molten chocolate cake.  The cake was done to perfection with both the outside and the inside done to text book form.Wine:  This category is what kept me from going to 4.5 stars.  I give the wine list an unimpressive 2.5 stars sorry.  It could really use some work.  There was no focus on the list I felt like it was a mish-mash of wines.  Prices were fair not great.  The thing that drove me nuts was they had nothing that was very good or great.  Yes they did have some nice bordeaux but they were from very off years and about 4 X what I think you could buy them for taking advantage of labels.  We ended up going with a Chateaneuf du Pape that was decent not great.  I think they could really improve here without at all changing the price deck.Overall Takeaway:  If you live in Boston or Cambridge I think this restaurant is a must at some point.  If you are visiting and want a really solid dinner in a good location I think you would be very happy.  Either way it would be hard for me to believe that you will walk away from this restaurant unstatisfied with the overall experience.  4 stars Bravo!Cheers,yes,,,,
"I suck when it comes to art. I dont know what anything means or who anyone is but i really enjoy going to MFA here and there. The last exhibit i went to was photography and it was awesome. That and crocheting are about the only forms of art that i ""get.""It is such a great and neat place to see works of art. I remember going here in highschool french class for monet and it was really flipping interesting.Other than that i dont know...but i say you need to go if you havent yet!",yes,,,,
Good place great food! This menu has so many different options meat loaf to pumpkin risotto! Very nice ambiance good service and ample parking. Always a good place to meet people who do not live I Southie. Great for families or just a night at the bar.,yes,,,,
I'm giving this place 5 stars for 5 simple reasons. 1 extremely friendly and attentive staff: my friends and I got here for brunch 10 minutes before 11 on Sunday and the waiter informed us that they can't serve alcohol before 11 on Sundays so we watched as he constantly checked his watch and at 11 on the dot told the bartender to make our bloody's that is what I call service 2 the bloody's are probably the best I have ever had anywhere and at $4 a pop you can't go wrong! 3 the food was tasty and the portions were great for the price I got an omlet and it was massive I couldn't finish it all 4 the ambiance is great yes this is a gay sports bar but for 3 young ladies wanting to enjoy a relaxed brunch it was perfect we purposely sought this place out because of it's chill-ness and 5 the overall picture is that this place is clean and casual has solid food and drinks has GREAT staff and is very reasonably priced especially for Boston. I will most certainly be back here!,yes,,,,
Delicato is a great place for lunch on the go in Downtown Crossing.  There are always several delicious soups to choose from and the sandwiches are simple and yummy.  I haven't tried the entrees but every time I'm in there someone orders one and they look pretty tasty as well.  Plus there's never a long line and the staff is extremely friendly.  And also cleanliness is maintained .The only downside is that they don't take credit cards so come ready with cash. Definitely worth a try if you're tired with your usual lunch options and want something simple fresh and new.,yes,,,,
Delicato is a surprisingly tasty place for being located in an Alley.  They are a little expensive but what isn't in Downtown Boston.  They have a bunch of different sandwiches on the menu try the Broker but can also make almost anything you dream up.  And you get the delicious bonus of pasta salad and pickle.  They have a selection of soups and hot entrees daily as well.   Area behind the counter is neat and clean.The people behind the counter are really super nice and always remember me when I go in.  Only problem is that the line situation is a little confused because it is hard to tell where to stand if you want a sandwich and where to stand if you want an entree.  All in all though four thumbs up!,yes,,,,
Did you ever notice that no matter where you get lunch in Downtown Boston...it costs $7.00?  Is this some sort of sick collusion?  Anywhooo...for about $7.00 you can get a very nice lunch at this little out of the way spot.  They are good for take out if you plan to eat in cube world or tables if you want to sit in a nice deli atmosphere.  Lot's of sandwich selections on the big menu board but a custom sandwich is no problem at all.  With heavy competition for your belly  these guys throw a little pasta salad at you just to keeps things honest and separate themselves a bit.  Shhhh....don't tell them the sandwiches are good enough that they don't have to!  Oh and breakfast here is dang good too.  An honest egg sandwich...,yes,,,,
I really wanted to love the Federalist because it is so cool inside and just screams of old Boston which I love... but it just wasn't so great which was upsetting.The service started off wonderfully and we did have a large party 8 of us but we were quickly forgotten once the patron next to us ordered a $1200 dollar bottle of wine.  I guess I can understand this if I'm a starving waiter frothing at the mouth for a tip on a $1200 dollar bottle of wine but still-  our tab was several  hundred dollars and this doesn't denote that we should get stiffed on service!The lobster bisque was very good my sirloin was tastey but not very memorable- and the supposed signature desert- the baked alaska- was just OK.  For the money spent I'd much sooner go somehwere else though I'd give the federalist another shot for an important date or dinner meeting if in a pinch.  I still really want to like it!,yes,,,,
I came here the other week for lunch when meeting a work contact.   I have lived in beacon hill for many years but have never made it up the hill to check this place out glad we did today.  Small selections for lunch but everything I had was quite good.  I enjoyed their onion soup on a cold rainy day and the fish sandwich I ordered on special was quite good.  If you are a potato chip kinda person definitely check this place out.  I opted for the chips than fries and I was gives a huge handful of fresh fried chips. Great atmosphereTables were neat and clean. I will likely be back!!,yes,,,,
What a disappointment!I haven't been to Scollay Square for quite a while but remembered it as pretty good from when my girlfriend and I had dinner there. So this past Monday I recommended the restaurant to some colleagues while we were in Boston for a business meeting. Unfortunately my coworkers and I went in for dinner and the food was terrible.The appetizers are the only thing keeping this from being a one-star review. They were decent but nothing better than the apps you can order at Applebee's. Nothing memorable.Four people in our party ordered the steak and it was an embarrassment. We all ordered our steaks medium rare but were given grayish tough steaks with no flavor. The waitress then informed us that the kitchen had run out of baked potatoes and one of us wouldn't get one. No big deal I asked for spinach instead. It was steamed but flavorless. The roasted asparagus was overcooked and the red onion jam was an afterthought at best.My colleagues remarked at how terrible their entrees were and I was embarrassed for ever recommending this placeTables were dirty .Management at Scollay Square should apologize for serving food this bad.,no,,,,
Friends and I were staying at the Omni Parker Hotel and the concierge recommended this place for brunch.  This was one of the best brunches I've had in a while.  I started with a bacon bloody mary that was well balanced and had a kick without being too spicy.  I originally was just going to get the fruit plate but our server said that I might want more food.  The fruit was fresh and amazing and the bowlful filled me up.   I ended up taking my bacon egg and cheese sandwich home.  Later that day when I was hungry again I reheated the sandwich and it was SO GOOD.  It was very flavorful and satisfying.  All-in-all it was a great visit!,yes,,,,
I would now consider us regulars as we venture up to Scolly Square at least once every two weeks. The food is phenomenal and the prices are great too. Also can't forget to mention the best brunch menu around with a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar!.Clean place,yes,,,,
Hungry I gets my vote for most romantic restaurant in Boston. Located sub-street-level on Charles St. it is small dim quiet and unassuming. There is no pretention here - and it doesn't feel like it's actually trying to be romantic at all...it just falls into this catagory with relative ease. Housed in a lovely old brownstone there are three dining rooms each with fireplaces and decorated with an array of antiques. I thumbed through a collection of antique books while at our table and thought it was absolutely charming.  Candles provide most of the lighting at each table which serves to make the atmosphere even more romantically charged - add the crackle of the fires and you have yourself a restaurant ripe with seduction. There are a few tables that have banquet style seating with charming benches strewn with embroidered pillows for lounging. After a few glasses of wine I might have been convinced to stage a lie-in and take a nap by the fire. The food is pricey but I thought it was cooked well. I had the breast of duck l'orange and it was juicy and flavorful. My dinner companion had one of the fish options and seemed quite satisfied.It's a perfect place to have an anniversary or Valentine's dinner...it's romantic charming quaint and cozy.,yes,,,,
One of the most romantic restaurants in Boston - very cozy with wood-burning fireplaces and tiny tables but clean.  Have been here a few times and it has never disappointed.  Last time I had the filet and I think it was the best steak I've ever had. Great wine list.,yes,,,,
We went to the Hungry I to celebrate our engagement and I'm happy to say that it is clearly one of the best choices I made in restaurants in a while.  It's perfectly intimate for a date.  It's in a well decorated basement with brownstone bricks small tables and a very intimate atmosphere.  Noise levels were quiet but we went at 8:30 or 9 p.m. on a Wednesday night.The service was EXCELLENT.  I had called them a few days ago to let them know that we'd be coming there to celebrate our engagement and they made sure that we had the table by the window/wall and that we had great service all through the night.  Our server was attentive knowledgeable and very warm.  The owner came over later on to check in on and us and also seemed like a great guy.  There was a couple behind us that were a little drunk but very friendly and fun and told us they had been coming there to celebrate their anniversary for 5 years.I don't exactly remember what we ate there but everything we had was incredible.  Right textures right tastes right scents.  It all worked very well together and the wine they recommended was pretty good too.Overall I think it's one of the best romantic date places in Boston.  Great food great area great service!,yes,,,,
I gave this place four stars because it accomplished what I wanted out of it.  A nice anniversary dinner that was classy.  We didn't get a window seat which I was extremely disappointed by but the view was still good from our table.  We did go look out the window by the jazz band setup after our meal and we were able to take in some of the view from there.  Some of the food is mediocre some is good.  The caesar salad was really good don't know if you can justify paying 9$ for a small salad though.  I had the lamb which was pretty good my girlfriends dish wasn't good though.  Cookies are overrated not good cheesecake dessert is 2 times as good and half the price go downstairs for dessert.  Back to the classy the service was outstanding.  Even though we are on the younger side and look even younger than our age we were treated with great respect and i felt like a millionaire dining here.  My waiter was dressed almost as nice as me hard to accomplish.  He seemed like a classy butler out of some movie or tv show.  The service was slow on purpose as it was meant to be a nice long romantic dinner.  Make sure you have a conversation when you dine here cause you will be sitting for a very long time especially between each course you order!  The view can be half of your conversation though it is that good.  So if you want to wow your significant other with a great classy atmosphere which is romantic or you're looking for that right special occasion place I say come here.  For a regular night out I don't see why you would come here with the prices so high and food not so good.,yes,,,,
"I would not recommend this restaurant.  I decided to follow the rave reviews and went with my wife. The service is mediocre to say the least but I already expected this from some of the reviews.  The food was not bad I have been to the Peruvian in sommerville machu pichu and this place is not better.  The real sour point with me is the hygiene of the place.  Not only did the food take forever to arrive but when it did it I found hairs in the lomo saltado.  When I complained to the waitress she reacted like it was no big deal!!  The taste might be good but God knows what ""extra seasonings"" they put on the dishes.  My take is that this place has poor hygiene.",no,,,,
Yes. This food is good and prepared fast. If you're looking for the fast food version of Chinese then by all means come here. I am a born and raised American-Chinese person who enjoys a good authentic Chinese meal. If you're like me you'll hate it here. I usually go to this chain when I'm at the airport. To me this place is authentic airport food.  The food they offer is geared towards Americans not Chinese families. Overall I think the hygiene of the restaraunt is a little poor. If you're looking for a quick fix, then this is the place if you're looking for authenticity, go somewhere else,no,,
"I tried to use a coupon for my sub which they skimped on all my ingredients anyway...  but they said that particular Subway chooses not to take coupons.  With much childish arguing on their part I won. However my boyfriend was not so lucky.  One day he saw the man cleaning the floor with bleach then he went to make my BF's sub without washing his hands.  My BF complained so the manager said he would make his sandwich as the other man continues to serve bleach-subs.  My BF says no please both of you wash your hands.  But the manager said ""Well you don't know when we wash our hands so maybe we washed them.""  My BF yelled at them left heard them talking behind his back so he went back and in continued the fight for proper hygiene. All of the workers here are miserable bitter childish and their energy poisons the already processed food... not to mention the special ingredient - clorox bleach!! Now we know.",no,,,,
JMP is probably the best Indian food I have tasted in Boston. This statement has been backed by 4 out of 5 of my Indian friends who say it's pretty close to mom's home cooking. It is also one of the few places in Boston that serves Halal food so it's Muslim friendly!I think the key here is to know what to order. The chicken tiki masala is quite dry. In fact none of the masala is all that good but the curry is awesome. I would try to be more adventurous and try either the lamb or goat curry both of which are great. BUT hands down the best dish to get here is the tandoori chicken. It takes about 30 mins to make and they cook it on a kabob stick in this big metal oven. Make sure to eat it with the lemon! The plain naan that comes with any lunch or dinner special is also really great again made fresh in the same metal oven as the tandoori chicken.The downside to this place is the service. I arrived there on a Saturday at around 11:30AM and no one was around even though the rest of the food court was already filled with customers at other stores. They don't post their hours anywhere so I guess you can't really fault them for not being open on time. And my biggest complaint about this place is the hygiene. I'm not sure if this place would pass a food inspection.So 5 stars for the tandoori chicken and naan but minus 1 for cleanliness.,no,,,,
Dirty clean the place. Not exactly appetizing hygiene. I only had a beer then I just had to leave before I got their cooties.,no,,,,
"My review is very out of date. Every time I remember the gastroenteritis I had two summers ago - I think ""man I have GOT to yelp about that..."" so here goes. In all fairness - this review is probably not valid simply because it's been so long since the ""incident"" but I still feel moved to yelp - I'm sure though I do not know that they have cleaned up their kitchen and / or their employee's have started washing their hands... and / or they have learned how to cook burgers... at least I hope so. I went to Sunday ""Pajama"" brunch with some friends two summers ago. We were all quite hungover and it was a good but quiet brunch. I ordered a delicious avocado and tomato cheeseburger with eggs and my god it was good. Until I got into the middle and found raw cold hamburger meat. I lost my appetite and stopped eating. I didn't say anything and didn't think anything of it until about 12 hours later... when I was woken up from sleep with the most intensely painful abdominal cramps I've ever experienced in my life. I was rolling around in pain and discomfort... and eventually ended up alternating vomiting into the toilet and using it for the ""other"" purpose... I vomited for about 24 hours with fever in 102 degree heat that Monday which was nice because hey - I felt cold - food smells and more than one gulp of water would send me to the toilet. The rest of the uncomfortable symptoms lasted for 4 days. That's right - 4 days. I called my doctor - I was so dehydrated I could barely stand.I can't walk past this place without feeling sick to my stomach. I told people about my experiences and apparently it had quite the reputation a few years ago that even a good location and fancy clientele couldn't dispel. I feel better for yelping it out.",no,,,,
This may have been the best meal I've ever had in the city! To start we got the BBQ wings. Best wings by far.  Generous portion served in a sweet/spicy sauce that I can't even describe! Get the fried chicken and you won't be disappointed! Service was awesome.  Our server answered any questions we had with a smile on his face and was great at recommending us what to get to eat and drink.  The open kitchen definitely held my attention for a good portion of the meal. It amazes me to watch all those people work in synchronization and so quickly and the end result is an amazing plate of food.I will definitely be back!,yes,,,,
This place is great. The menu offers a lot of variety and it's all good. I particularly like that the food is so tasty but yet not fat. Service is great too. Definitely one of the best places for lunch downtown. The only downside is the location the place is kinda stinky but since it's take out only you won't have to stay there for long.,no,,,,
I think I ate here every day for a solid six months last year and then took a new job and didn't get to venture out for lunch as often but Cafe Delicato's chili keeps me coming back for more whenever I get the chance.  The owner and the staff are super friendly!!.Tables and kitchen were clean,yes,,,,
Whoa. This place is good. Monday through Friday mornings are made better by the presence of Delicato. I try to expand my horizons past a bacon egg and cheese extra cheese on a bagel but it's just so delicious that I can't seem to deny it. Matched with a Vitamin Water or Nantucket Nectars and you'll have yourself a pretty excellent breakfast.Lunch is also good. I'll be honest I haven't had too much from there in terms of the lunch menu but what I have had BLT grilled cheese with bacon - I like bacon - is really tasty. You also get a pretty tangy side of pasta salad always a nice bonus to any meal. There is also a pretty decent drink selection. Extra bonus? Their menu is available online so if you aren't quite sure what you want that day but you're really curious about the specials just pop online and check it out. Awesome. I love a place that allows me to be fat and lazy at the same time.I've gotta give props to the excellent staff. So friendly. They clearly don't judge me every time I go in and order the same thing for breakfast and they even ask me if I am picking anything up for my friends at work. They started to recognize me only after a few visits which is pretty awesome considering how swamped it can get in the morning.Good amount of seating available but don't expect to take a huge party there. It's a nice spot to sit down for lunch or breakfast and read the paper or a book. Just don't be that person who hogs the table when there are clearly people waiting to grab a seat.Talk about food selection. I know I know I've only gotten the same thing over a couple times. But their menu is just so huge that I get overwhelmed and blurt out the first thing with bacon that comes to mind. That's another bonus to having the menu online. You can prep before going in and not be swayed by all the fall back easy things to order.Hours are from Monday to Friday open until 3 so it's definitely a great place to check out during the work week. It's worth making a few trips there as well because there are so many options. And it's just a cute little deli. Who doesn't like that?,yes,,,,
Everyday I love this place more and more.  The ladies of my office and I have taken to getting breakfast sandwiches here and I have now had to limit myself just to one a week.  Bacon Egg and Extra Cheese on a bagel with a little ketchup.  That makes a depressing morning stuck in the office not quite as terrible.  The staff knows us and always asks if we want the usual.  Good times all around!  As Jocelyn C' said  the bottled drinks selection is the best for the area!  anything from soda to vitamin water to honest ade and tea!  I seriously and truly love Delicato!  Too many exclamation marks!,yes,,,,
This off the beaten path spot is a place you should find.  I would rate it higher but I've only been here a few times.  However every time I've been here it's been very good and I can't wait to get over more.  A huge menu with very small print with all sorts of sandwiches that have names personally a big fan of The Cowboy.  Friendly staff.  Big portions.  Quality food.  What's not to like.  Be aware though the set up is a little funky with the line/ordering.,yes,,,,
Five stars for you!As I sit here updating my review on Delicato I am munching on a grilled cheese with bacon of course and a side of pasta salad. The only thing that could have made this better is if I had remembered to pick up a chocolate chip cookie. Next time.The service is great the menu is huge the chocolate chip cookies are delicious when you pull it apart chocolate oozes... gorgeous and it's just a nice place to grab either a quick bite to eat or to sit with a friend and chat for a while. You are always greeted with a smile.I don't even know what else to say. It's just fabulous and you should really try it.,yes,,,,
Delicato has become a regular in the lunch rotation now that I've been there a few more times.  Good portions quality ingredients and a great staff.  Don't hesitate to go here for breakfast sandwiches either.  They do a mean bacon egg and cheese.,yes,,,,
Just ate here for the first time and it's right by my office. It's very convenient and great service. I was in and out with my meal in under 5 minutes which is not easy to find.  I ordered a lunch special but I think it's on the regular menu.  Turkey wrap with sprouts lettuce tomato carrots and dijon mustard.  Good but not great. I think the mustard was bland which didn't help so it was only ok nothing jumped out at me.  But it did come with some pasta salad and a pickel which was a surprise,  I will try it again because the reviews are good and it's easy and other things looked good on the menu.  Cute little place too!,yes,,,
"Food court lunches only to be eaten in moments of Thai desperation. Nice people. Everything is like $5 which I like.I had a breaded chicken dish in basil sauce twice. I think they call it Homestyle Chicken or something. The first time it was surprisingly tasty but the second time I felt ill afterward. Stay away from the bland red curry chicken. One brave day I also tried the ""Seafood Madness."" It wasn't bad for $5 consisted of mostly imitation crab in a pleasant brown sauce but also it was smelly and dirty place.",no,,,,
Fucking puke fest. I got throw up and poopy ill after eating crab cakes here last summer. Seriously no fun. I thought this place was great because they have a outside seatign area where you can smoke and word of mouth has it that dogs are OK outside so I went. I had been years before and an uneventful experience with a guiness and shephards pie. but visit #2 which also included a $9 johnny black & soda ont he rocks fucking strip club prices man is really what i'm writing about. if you can skip this tourist trap save your cash and innards for another crap fest down the street.,no,,,,
I just ordered take-out from Misono - a spicy tuna roll and a philly roll my stand-bys - and I gotta say I was NOT impressed!  Based on these other reviews maybe I need to give it one more try but I'm really not inclined to try any more sushi.  The fish didn't seem extremely fresh salmon should not look like gray jelly and the cucumbers in both of my rolls were soggy and looked rotten.  The rolls were not even rolled well - they all fell apart.  The upside I guess is that the price was pretty low lunch special - two rolls and miso soup for under $10 and I only feel a little ill as a result.,no,,,,
I ordered the lobster and several fish dinners for friends.  To make a long story short....food poisoning.  We all became quite ill and the food was quite bad.  The servers are very rude and almost no one speaks English.  Stay away from Boston and Maine!,no,,,,
I was very iffy about coming here. I read a lot of reviews bad ones at that before I came. I was going on a date and I strongly suggested we go somewhere else after seeing over 10 horrible reviews whether it be about the service or the food. But my date insisted we go here so I thought why not its boston it can't be that bad. We got there and it was a cute restaurant. Very small though. We were seated in a window which was great. We had a nice street view and men playing instruments came and played music for us. There was another table next to us that ended up being filled. It was really close and kind of awkward with another couple almost on top of us it almost looked as if we were all together. I orderd the shrimp scampi thinking where could I go wrong. It didn't taste bad just very bland Food wasnt fresh. My date got the Chicken parm which I should have ordered. His meal was excellent great sauce.My meal on the other hand ended up making me sick. I was violently ill the next day. I'm not sure if it was food poisoning but I ended up in the hospital because I couldn't even keep water down. It's quaint but I would stay far FAR away from their fish!!!,no,,,,
This review is a long time coming!I have been here a couple times and I have only had great experiences here. I would go as far as to say this is the BEST tapas restaurant I have been to in Boston. Let me explain why:1. The bar. Makes this place a perfect first date. The bartender I have been served by twice now I wish I knew his name! is extremely personable and patient. He overheard me talking about how much I love Aviations a bomb gin drink. - highly recommend it! and suggested I try that night's drink special which was very similar. However my FAVORITE drink at this spot is the El Diablo. Tables and floors were clean and decorated nicely It's a tequila drink with actual pepper flakes. Spicy savoy and all out amazing. If spicy and tequila are 2 things you like you'll LOVE the Diablo.2. Parking. . Highly recommend!,yes,,,,
While in search of the perfect after class relaxation destination  I found Estragon on Harrison. It is way too close to school for my own good! I have been to Estragon four  times now and I'm addicted! It's a great place to unwind with tons of cava and tapas. The tapas are delicious- especially the fried artichoke hearts and the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese. So not kosher but oh so good......Kitchen was clean ..,yes,,,,
"it's my first time to try jo jo taipeii love it so much definitely gonna come back more often.everything we order is awesomeespecially the lamb and soup....and i love their special teait tastes good and it's good for the health and skin. recommend it to all the ladies.....     to be honest it's the best taiwanese restaurant in boston. Tables were neat and clean .A cute girl called ""lucy"" is our server today she's so pretty cute and outgoinglove her so much.....    btw make sure if have cash when you go to this placecuz if you pay cashu gonna get 10% off.......",yes,,,,
Terrible I placed an order to go.  While I'm there waiting I hear a rat run across the ceiling.  So I left.,no,,,,
I used to live above this place and the owner was also my landlord.he's a mess pays off the health department. This place is NASTY. The Taco Bell Rat video was NOTHING compared to what goes on here and the roches are out of control.if you go here make your next stop the hospital!One star too many.,no,,,,
Food was good I had the halibut very tasty and the raspberry vinegarette was great.  The drinks were good.  The caesar salad was tasty the dressing was especially good.  The bill was a bit expensive around $320 for a group of five.  Our waiter Allen was fantastic.  I would recommend that you ask for him if you decide to visit this restaurant. IT was neat and clean . He was attentive to our needs took our orders promptly and even gave suggestions about some great food choices.   The rest of the staff was quick to fill our water glasses and remove our plates as we finished each course.  We were seated near the window which we were hoping for.  The view of the city was nice but there were bones and feathers on the deck outside our window.  I also saw a rat running around outside kind of gross but it was outside.   I would hope that the owner of the restaurant would be more attentive to these little details especially when the food is quite costly.  Parking was free and there were plenty of spaces.  The pictures of all of the celebrity guests posted on the lobby walls were neat to look at.  Reservations were made on opentable.com and we were seated promptly upon arrival.  Overall it was a good experience but hopefully they will clean up their deck!,yes,,,,
Dining with the RATS:So it is most likely that they will not be turning tables that fast, and that's part of the reason why you are paying that much for dinner.  They should just get rid of the mentality that they are the Cheese Cake factory where they depend on tables having a fast turnover rate.I hope I am being fair to the food and the view but as long as that place is clear of the rats.... NEVER AGAIN!,no,,,
Since we were eight people we made a reservation for dinner. A while after our reservation time we noticed other people without reservations being seated. When we asked we were told that it was a mistake because they didn't SEE those tables. I guess it happens. We finally got seated at 10pm and our server was so terribly rude appeared hormonal that it didn't seem worth it. But they did replace our server and the manager also brought us some complimentary appetizers. The remedial actions would've saved the day and the food by itself was alright. But as we were leaving we saw a big rat run out from under the restaurant and into the sewer!!! Disgusting. I would think being a restaurant they would want to make sure their pest control is up to date. All in all very disappointing experience.,no,,,,
Stopped in for lunch on 2/9/12.  The staff was friendly service was fast.  The restaurant had a bit of an odd smell to it...maybe they were cooking up something funky in the back...I don't know.The food was OK at best.  The chicken and broccoli was a bit plain and didn't really have any taste to it.  The pork friend rice was average and the wonton soup was bland with only broth and some wontons nothing else like peapods or pork strips.  The best tasting item on my plate was the crab rangoons which were nice and crispy.They may have a bit of a rodent problem as a rat scurried across the dining room floor as I ate.  The guy sitting next to me saw it and walked out...I will not return...,no,,,,
My friend and I ate here last Saturday b/c we couldn't get a table at Jerry Remys bc of the final four game.  My friend saw a RAT while we were eating & the management knew about it!  I will NEVER eat here again.,no,,,,
"There are not many places in Boston you can use the word ""revolting"" to describe without being overly dramatic... this is absolutely one of them.  It is convenient to Fanuel Hall and they have a good dance floor and the entertainment is decent in terms of music and cover bands however if you are older than 231/2 you may be too old to enjoy this place.  Tends to be very frat party - with guys the requisite white baseball hat turned backward and stumbling drunk chicks wearing plastic tiaras prouding proclaiming ""21!""  Proof of this is further found upon entering the restrooms.   It is by far - the worst most disgusting ladies bathroom I have ever stepped foot in and is like this every single time I step foot in there.  I have plenty to compare to - I went to college at UMass AND am old enough to have gone to The Rat before it closed down..  The toilets are always backed up there is generally vomit in the sink and I once heard that a woman sued and won because she fell through the floor because it was rotten.  If you are fortunate enough to get the bartenders attention NOT an easy feat the drinks are watered down.  I have never eaten here - but don't think I could bring myself to do it..",no,,,,
What is that overwhelming stench coming from the basement? I mean down the sketchy stairs where the bathrooms storage room rat gallery and what smells like an antique cabbage collection are all housed?...Ohhhh that smell? It's urine. Gahd the Hub Pub is pretty nasty. The location is messed up across from where the Littlest Bar used to be on a semi deserted Downtown X-ing side street. I used to come here all the time for lunch because it was cheap. I see the years haven't been as kind to the Hub Pub as they have been to me fixing hair in the mirror adjusting my ascot. I still think that a $7 semi-OK club sando is Ok here but when you mix that rotting cabbage smell with food you just sort of lose your appetite. I suppose you could have fun here but remember this is not a dive bar - this is a shitty bar.,no,,,,
I just went there tonight with some friends tonight for dinner. We were seated on the upper level for dinner and drinks. There were 5 of us sitting up there.  As we were waiting for our meal one of my friends said that he saw a rat. I laughed and told him that he was crazy.  Then another friend saw a rat then I saw a rat. When we told the waitress she said that the owner would be notified. When she came back up again the rat ran across her path. She never once apologized or offered us so much as a free drink. We paid the check and scurried out. I won't be going back there again anytime soon.,no,,,,
There are so few interesting restaurants convenient to Government Center. Are there *any* actually besides Grotto? I'm a big fan of their creative risotti and their wine list and the semi-underground aesthetic of the place is deliciously cozy in the nasty Boston wintertime. Grotto was my standby when meeting friends for dinner after work......until one of my colleagues told me he wouldn't go back not since he saw the rat run across the dining room floor.Make of this what you will. I never had anything but a perfectly fine experience at Grotto. But since he told me this I haven't been back.,no,,,,
"i used to like Fire & Ice.Until my friend and I saw a rat run across the dining room while we were talking to the waiter.  He nonchalantly said ""Oh...it comes out around this time each night"".  SERIOUSLY?!?",no,,,,
We where sitting down enjoying our dinner and waiting for dessert and WE SAW A HUGE RAT WALK BY when we informed them of it they told us it's normal! That's not sanitary and to top it off they said there was nothing they could do for us!,no,,,,
We went here yesterday for Thankgiving.  I feel pretty confident that I got food poisoning or coincidentally came down with a stomach bug about 4 hours after eating here.  UGH.I got the Squash bisque Salmon and Creme Brulee.  They all tasted good but were entirely too rich--so much butter!!  I don't typically eat food as rich or as laden in butterso I thought that maybe my body was having a hard time digest the rich food.  And cue 8 hours of feverish vomiting.  Had I not gotten sick I'd be giving our experience 4-5 stars.  I am afraid though that the food may have been compromised and for the price I paid it may be a while until I can stomach pun intended going back. :,no,,,,
DON'T EAT HERE. I got really bad food poisoning after eating the chicken pad thai.,no,,,,
Don't bother. Food is as bad as everybody says it is. I ordered well aware of the reviews because it's snowing outside and it's close to where I live hoping to avoid a long delivery wait. Delivery took about 30 minutes. Not bad. Crab Rangoon were overflowing in a takeout container and were lukewarm. Didn't really matter because they're basically cream cheese on the inside. Moo goo gai pan is tasteless. Wanton soup smelled weird and I tossed it. I'm giving it 2 stars because I don't think I'm going to get food poisoning but I guess we'll have to wait and see. If I end up hospitalized I will update the review.,yes,,,,
I ordered a simple Pad Thai. The chicken was raw. I will never set foot in this place again. Avoid at all costs unless food poisoning is an acceptable risk to you.,no,,,,
I went into Miami Restaurant earnestly looking for quality Cuban food.  My girlfriend and I could not be more wrong to give this place a try.  The first red light turned on when we realized that most of the people there weren't eating at all.  They were just drinking beers and watching soccer. This was at a prime dinnertime on a weekend.  The next warning should have been that the waitress who is dressed like she is about to go to a nightclub did not speak ANY English.  I understand that English is not the first language for everybody but I would think that you would least have to be able to communicate the menu or to understand food allergies for customers.  Luckily neither of us are fussy or have any outstanding food preferences so we just picked some very basic dishes off the menu.  It took FOREVER for the food to come out and when it did it was barely edible.  The proteins were way overcooked the food was bland and the salad carelessly chopped lettuce and tomatoes did not have any flavoring AT ALL.  Somebody tell me how any of this is excusable?  I guess I should be happy I didn't get food poisoning because the ingredients looked stale. On top of everything the price we paid for the garbage they tried to pass for food was egregious.  Yelpers do yourself a favor and skip this place unless you want to watch soccer matches and enjoy a couple bottles of Corona.,no,,,,
"Zero Stars!!!I can feel my arteries hardening just thinking about this place.I should have stuck with my usual Captain Nemo's but one night I ventured another block and decided to give this place a shot. My stomach will never forgive me.The first thing I noticed upon entering was the counter is extremely high. At 5'3"" I felt like I could barely see over it. A strange thing to take notice of but it just seemed very unwelcoming to me. And I'm also sketchy and like to see who/what is touching the food I'm about to consume. The employees weren't anything to write home about either. Not especially chatty or friendly. The menu had the usual greasy/fried options you'd find at any pizza/sub joint. After careful consideration I decided to go for the steak and cheese.I was starving so by the time I got home I devoured almost half the sub without really tasting/thinking about it.But suddenly I realized that something just wasn't right. Although I couldn't put my finger on it I had someone else take a bite and they also agreed the taste was WAY off. This lead to me puking in an attempt to prevent possible food poisoning TMI?. Needless to say it took care of my hunger but not in the way I was expecting. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food but I learned my lesson and you can find me at Nemo's from now on",no,,,,
My wife and I went here once for lunch and thought it was decent so when a Groupon came out for it we figured we'd buy it and go back.  On the second visit the service was terrible despite it not even being half full the mixed drinks that sounded awesome on the menu weren't and the same was true of their specialty burger that I ordered.  While I was eating it I thought something tasted a little off but I chalked it up to the food being as iffy as the drinks.  Turns out there was definitely something off about it because I didn't feel right even as we were leaving the restaurant and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom giving it back from both ends.  As overpriced and trendy as this place is you shouldn't be getting food poisoning.  There are better restaurants in the neighborhood.  Go elsewhere.,no,,,,
DO NOT EAT HERE! I was served rotten calamari and suffered serious food poisoning 3 hours later. I am generally not one to get food poisoning but this was pretty rough. Beware when ordering from Squealing Pig.,no,,,,
"Right now as it stands...My hubby and his family and I went to eat at the grill..and while most of the family had the cheeseburger meal with fries...two of us had fish meals both different! While I thought that the food tasted pretty good..We all ended up with food poisoning...hubby was the most sick in the whole group who went!!! We were only in Boston for about three to four days..and I was worried we would NOT make it to the airport because hubby was more ill than I was..but we are STILL both sick!! It has lasted a bit longer than I would have preferred!!! I asked my step son to report it to the restaurant..and they said that they would ""do something about it""..but now I am thinking that I will call the Health Department..and this is NOT because I would like this place to be closed down...rather that  I would loove for them to look INTO the issues at hand..and CHANGE what needs to be changed..and to KEEP the place running well as it always has been!!! I have heard good things about this place..but in order for it to stay in working condition and in ""good standings"" with the public etc..they need to be more ""ON TOP OF IT!!!""",no,,,,
"I had visions of a new favorite breakfast joint when I walked into Sorella's for the first time and started flipping through the expansive menu. With specials like cornbread french toast avocado in almost every dish and loads of veggie options how could you go wrong?Lets start with the good. Their coffee is decent and the server came by several times to refill my mug. Also the breakfast sandwich I ordered was pretty solid egg/cheese w/ avocado sprouts and lox on everything bagel.What made me give this two stars is the fresh fruit bowl I ordered. It was pretty much the opposite of ""fresh"". The strawberries were mushy and had rotten spots all over them. The cantaloupe kiwi and honeydew were previously frozen and mushy to the point where it almost fell apart on my fork. I guess my biggest gripe is that they advertise this as ""fresh"" when it's obviously not. I might go back again but would stay far away from anything with fruit which is a shame because their pancakes with fruit sounded pretty awesome.",no,,,,
I also ended up at the point last weekend St. Patty's day because there was a huge line everywhere else. I got hit up with a $10 cover charge. I was able to snag a table and really enjoyed the cover band that was playing... I don't know their name but they sounded very authentic! People were dancing like crazy to their oldies hits.It was really crowded as you would expect so it made it a little difficult to belly up to the bar to get a drink. But when you did they had a lot of beers that I like on draft. There is nothing that particularly stands out about this bar... except for one thing... there was a horrible rotten egg smell wafting through the place the whole night! I have no idea where it was coming from...,no,,,,
Rotten food! Beware! Some of the steamed broccoli was black in the center and had split open. When I called about it they insisted that we didn't like the way it was cooked. At first they told us some people like it cooked that way then they tried the excuse that the color was from the sauce - the whole dish was STEAMED! Moreover for a second dish they did not follow the special instructions for it to be spicy. Not as big a deal as rotten vegetables.,no,,,,
This is place is seriously underwhelming. The decor needs to be updated and so does its food. I went with a couple girlfriends tonight for dinner and I wasn't impressed. There were only two or three people eating tonight so service was good. However...on to the more important part - food!I ordered the salmon tempura roll and the spicy tuna roll. I also sampled a few other rolls that my friends ordered and the udon noodle soup. First the fish didn't taste fresh. The salmon rolls were forgettable and the fish had this strange stick to your teeth thing going on. The spicy tuna wasn't spicy and I could barely  taste the mayo. The salmon in my salmon tempura roll was really dry in the middle - maybe from being overcooked or previously frozen - don't know which it was. The sushi was just okay nothing to rave about. The udon noodle soup was sub-par: the noodles were fine but the broth was heavy on the mushroom flavor salty and unusually thick. The onki mushrooms were still stuck together when my friend fished a bit out of her soup. I didn't enjoy much of the food to say the least. One positive was that there was 8 healthy sized pieces of the spicy tuna and 6 huge pieces of the salmon tempura which left me full.I also went to use their restroom and it had this foul smell to it. I can't even describe to you what it smelled like - it wasn't strong or anything but one of those smells that creep up on you as you stay in the area longer. After just a minute in there I began to feel sick and wanted to throw up. AVOID THEIR BATHROOM!My advice - skip Maluken and take a 5 min walk over to Fin's on Beacon near Uburger - the fish is so much better quality and almost the same price. The value is exponentially better at Fin's and you'll be able to taste the difference.,no,,,,
I think I ate here every day for a solid six months last year and then took a new job and didn't get to venture out for lunch as often but Cafe Delicato's chili keeps me coming back for more whenever I get the chance.  The owner and the staff are super friendly!!,yes,,,,
Come here for the Boston Cream Pie and forget all the other nonsense!!! If you don't want to have to sit in the dining room go to Last Hurrah which is their bar!,yes,,,,
Food aside it really doesn't taste much different from my favorite Uno's in New Hampshire EW.  The bathrooms were sickening there was a dude rudely panhandling us while we were seated on the patio MULTIPLE TIMES and our server basically sucked.  The second star is simply for the fact that they HAVE a patio which is mostly empty probably because of all the other factors.,no,,,,
The median age is 55 and most patrons are U-G-L-Y.I left this bar after I ordered beer and ten minutes later it still hadn't arrived.  Why???Well one bartender was kissing the other bartender's...crotch.It's nast and not worth your time.  Stay away unless you like skank and the like.,no,,,,
I LOVE Rico's!!! Their Macaroni & Cheese is the best in the city! The people that work there are very nice and can get you in and out quickly during the lunch rush. All of their specials and slices are really good  but the Mac & Cheese on Wednesday and Friday is great!,yes,,,,
I just had probably the worst chicken parm sub I've ever had here. Barely lukewarm no sauce tasteless dry chicken. When I saw them preparing it I knew I was in trouble. : On top of it all it cost $7.50! Even the Sbarro in Kendall Square was better.I've been avoiding this place but will more than likely never return. Bleechchhhh!! There are many many better options in the area like Sam LaGrassa's/Pedro's even Boloco I suggest you check them out.,no,,,,
"I came by for lunch with a friend today and I can only say two good things about this place: 1 pizza portions are huge quarter of a pie = 1 slice and 2 it's very clean for a ""cafeteria"" style location.These things aside their broccoli and chicken ziti was below mediocre. It was cold soupy and had the taste of the cutting board. Also the fountain drink were limited and tasted OLD if that's possible. I had the chance to take a peak into the kitchen and it was absolutely empty in terms of activities even though it was 1pm.I don't know if I'll come back but the pizza looked okay so I might go and try their pizza but never again will I have their pasta.",yes,,,,
"Okay full disclosure: I'm a Locke-Ober addict as I should be having dined there annually for 40 years family tradition.L-O's ambiance is one-of-a-kind obviously some love it and others hate it.  It's a blast from the distant past - if you're not interested in that sort of thing go elsewhere!Another thing it brings forward from the past is the service - just about the best of any restaurant I've been to.  The waitstaff is attentive but not intrusive and very knowledgeable.  These are people who have made waiting on tables their career and it shows.The food... over the years it's been up and down.  Never bad but sometimes just so-so.  But for the past 3-4 years it's been really good - not quite 10/10 and maybe not *quite* enough to justify the high prices but very good.Last night when my brother and I dined there he started with the lobster stew and I with a Caesar salad.  Both were fantastic.  The salad greens were fresh and crispy and the dressing wasn't a tweaked Italian like most these days it was a good traditional Caesar with balanced flavors of garlic egg oil and a hint of anchovy.  My brother liked the stew and it had large chunks of lobster in it.For the main course we both had the ribeye steak.  The portions were very generous and the flavor and tenderness were on a par with Capitol Grille which is my benchmark for a great steak.  I will admit that both were just slightly undercooked - we ordered medium-rare and some parts of both were thoroughly red.For sides we both had the asparagus and liked it very much - the flavor was good and it was cooked perfectly.  I also had the pommes frites aka french fries :^  which were very good.Dessert for both of us yes we think alike was the ""soft chocolate cake with peppermint stick ice cream and whipped cream"".  The portion size was a little small but we were pretty stuffed from the rest of the meal anyway and compared to other things on the menu it's relatively inexpensive.  And it was fantastic - we both really liked it.  The cake was very rich and the ice cream was very peppermint-y.The only negative thing I can really think of and this is minor was the bread supplied before the meal - two pieces of cranberry nut bread.  It was fine but I'm not a big fan of cranberry nut bread - it would have been nice if they were a little more generous and supplied a couple of different kinds of bread.  If like many people I had a nut allergy I'd have been pretty upset.Anyhow overall I'd give the experience 5 stars and the food 4.  Would have given 4-1/2 overall if Yelp could do half-stars.",no,,,,
A bacteriological nightmareSalmonella and E. coli everywhere.Seated an hour lateWith a reservation for our date.Fingerprints were on everythingLots of birthday songs to sing.Sirloin as chewy as old gumI hope I don't have the poops out my bum.All of the handles at the buffet were stickyEwwwww I felt really icky.My server's name I do not knowCaring for customers doesn't show.When I left this place tonightI felt absolutely no delight.I will not be backNot even for a free snack.Yelpers bewareof this bacteriological nightmare.,no,,,,
Just wanted to write an update that the day after writing this review I came down with awful food poisoning for 3 days. I had to go to the doctor because I had never been that sick for more than 24 hours. My lab results came back that I had Campylobacteriosis a food borne illness similar to Salmonella.I received a call from a city of Boston public nurse to ask me questions about this and talk to be about the bacteria. She said it is very common in undercooked meat. I said I hadn't eaten much meat at all and asked about seafood. Her first response? Oysters!I feel 90% sure that I got sick from Brasserie Jo.,no,,,,
I used to live in Boston and I love this chain for some bizarre reason so I was happy to see on close to my hotel.Went in a mid-afternoon weekday.  Seemed to be on a skeleton crew.  Had to stand around and wait for someone to come behind the counter and serve me.Good pastries and sandwiches. Free wifi.Went back a day or so later in the morning and there seemed to be more staff there so it went a bit more quickly.  Staff who was there were friendly so I'd go back.Good chocolate croissants.  And normally I run screaming from most places' salmonella-laced tuna salad sandwiches but I've never gotten sick from theirs knock on wood and I've tried it both in Boston NY and Philly.  Kudos for the non-poisonous tuna from ABP!,yes,,,,
"I'm sure we've all made the mistake of getting salmonella from the veggie burger or having your friend puke up the nachos on a Saturday night or sipped on the overpriced stale tasting beers on tap. But hey I only liked I could sub my fries for mashed potatoes but that isn't enough to make me ever step foot in this place again. It's a perfect place for a mildly retarded BU or any ""college bro"" or your tramp stamp kind of gal which makes its two locations in Allston perfect for those rowdy and obnoxious bunches of kids.I won't even get into big city other then when bravos make better pizza then you. A new cook might be in order.",yes,,,,
"Z Square's second branch has finally opened just down from Kenmore tucked within BU. Like me you may ask yourself ""WHY?"" I mean Z Square tries to be a classy sit-down place with glasses of wine so why open in the middle of BU's campus?They must've done their homework that's why. Kenmore has ESK getting great business every day but very little else other than burgers bagels and burritos. On top of that I bet Z Square were sitting there in Harvard seeing rich kid after rich kid trot over from campus each day and spend daddy's money. Where next? BU... bingo!So yes on a Friday lunchtime they were doing great business from the BU-clad Jersey Girls with their Uggs and LV bags. They should thrive here. And why not? It's actually far more bearable than the Harvard location as here they are content to just be cafe that serves good food and not try to be a million other things either. The decor is neat and bright and the big windows make it an appealing spot.I won't be having lunch here every day - it's a Friday-place you go with colleagues for an end-of-week $15 treat. But it's good- my chowder my sandwich and my fries were all top-notch and served promptly on nice plates. SOLID STUFF.My major complaint:Vibrating pagers for your orders blah blah blah I hate the pagers thing. Whatever.",yes,,,,
"Went here for Restaurant Week.  Most RW discounts are tiny but  at Oceanaire it's a real bargain.  Compared to the standard prices you are saving 40%.The 'room' feels as if it is an atrium with a two story ceiling - open airy decorated like from the thirties with billie holiday playing on the sound system.  It actually reminded me of The Shining.  You know as the camera slowly dollies down the empty hallways evoking a spooky feeling of the horror about to ensue.The waitress was incredibly gracious and accomodating explaining their expensive menu... until we asked for the restaurant week menu.   She instantly became cold and curt and remained so until we ordered drinks and an extra appetizer.  Suddenly we were back in her good graces and she returned to her vivacious accomodating demeanor.    Note to self:  Ordering overpriced drinks = better service.Most entrees vary between $27 - $33.  Appetizers are generally $7 - $10.  Desserts are about $7.  And sides which you need to order separately from your meal are $5 - $10.Like a lot of 'high-end' mass marketed restaurants these days sides are served and priced separately.  Someone must have written an article in a restauranteur magazine since its been so heavily adopted.  Ruth Chris. Henrietta's Table etc.  We started with escargot - submerged in butter and pesto sauce.  The escargot was not as frightening as I expected.  It was succulent though oversalted.  On a scale of 1 - 10 it earned an 8.Next came clam chowder.  A much lighter brothier version than that offered at Legal's.  If you think Legal's is too heavy with cream and butter Oceanaire's is an excellent alternative.  It earns an 8.The Caesar Salad was the first miss.  We were led to believe it would be traditional Caesar with shaved parmesan and anchovies which you'd expect at a seafood restaurant.  Instead it seemed like overly chopped romaine with bottled Ranch Dressing and Pepperidge Farm croutons.  It earns a 2.For the main course we ordered the crabcake dinner plate and flounder with shrimp and brie stuffing.The crabcakes were the stars of the meal.  Rate them a nine.  It wasn't a traditional crabcake of 90% bread and 10% crab.  Instead it was 95% of fresh crab mixed with mayonnaise and sauteed for a minute on each side.  Delicious.  Ya know when Crab is served fresh it's actually good.  Makes me wonder what all those other restaurants are serving.The flounder was a real miss and you should avoid ordering it.  It tasted assembly line made instead of something freshly prepared like one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  It seemed like it had been sitting in a steamer tray at a buffet for hours - exceedingly dry and mediocre.  I'd rate it a 1.For sides we ordered the ""hash browns"".  Our waitress warned us about them but her warning made it more appealing - it is served heavy with tabasco and bacon.  We ordered the small which can easily serve six people. The large is 4 pounds!  It is a giant 3 inch deep disc browned and crispy on both sides with a healthy dollop of chopped bacon in the center.  It was gorgeous to look at.The waitress wasn't kidding about the tabasco.  You could smell it from across the room.  Based on the description I would rate it a 10 - crispy crunchy potatoes with bacon and hot sauce.  I LOVE tabasco on french fries.  But alas in my opinion this was a miss.  There wasn't just a little bacon in the hash.  It felt like there was a pound of bacon and it seemed as if the mixture of shredded potatoes and bacon and onions with cream had been prepared in a frying pan in such a way as to be certain the potatoes sucked up all the bacon fat that is usually drained away when you cook bacon at home.  Frankly it tasted like a coronary.   While the outside was beautifully crispy and crunchy the inside was creamy and heavy.  Tabasco does not go well on creamy foods.  It needs a something more solid to contrast against.  As a result it just tasted like a scoop of scorching lard.  My partner who loves high fat foods called it 'heaven' and raved about it saying it was the highlight of the meal.  On everything else we were in complete agreement.  Here though I'd rate it a 2 he'd rate it a 10.We concluded with desserts which tasted like they were pre-made at the oceanaire factory.  Adequate but nothing to write home about.  All in all this would fall under the description 'high end chain food'.   Similar to Ruth Chris.  Better but similar to cheesecake factory.  It was good but it felt a little 'mechanical' a little formulaic like everything the staff did came from a manual.  It just didn't feel authentic.  It didn't feel like we were enjoying a truly unique experience like one gets at high end locally owned restaurants.But I enjoyed it nonetheless and might go back.  The ambiance counts for a lot and its preferably to eating in a basement like at ruth chris.",yes,,,,
"I came here with a few friends for restaurant week last year and there were mixed emotions all of which come from me. I'll give you a slight play by play here. So half of the party gets there first and is seated. My friend and I arrive 2 or 3 minutes later and are rudely ""greeted"" he didn't really greet us by the host. Now at the table the four of us are introduced to our waiter. Side analysis of the waiter. He was a very good server. He was very attentive but maybe tooo attentive. He was for lack of a better word creepy. After looking at our choices most order off RW menu. All courses com out in a timely manner and is delicious! Me being the super eater I am can barely even finish my entree which had no side. Kind of weak I know. But we all finish what we can. So to sum up my ""play by play""; despite the pissy maitre d' and creepiness: service was very good restaurant is beautiful and food is yummy. I am coming back. last side note. doorman was cute.",yes,,,,
"This is my go-to place for Friday night Happy Hour when I'm in the mood for something a bit more civilized than my norm.  I have also been to/hosted gatherings here.  The food is fantastic -  some of my favorites are the fish tacos sliders truffle fries steamed mussels and shrimp.   On to service - the other night my friend and I were there enjoying a fantastic evening with attentive and friendly bartenders when a ""gentleman"" sat at the raw bar next to us.  This person was so extremely rude to the bartenders.   At one point he literally threw the check and the pen at the staff and the pen bounced and hit my friend square in the chest.   Not being shy my friend had to call him on it.  He did apologize but then started asking us all sorts of questions about ""being from Boston"" and ""did we go to college"" and ""why couldn't he detect an accent?""....Um not all of us are extras from Ben Affleck movies.   In any case - the bartenders were so extremely patient and kind to this jerk that we felt the need to talk to manager and make sure they got a pat on the back.  KUDOS FELLAS!!   FIVE STARS FOR THE SERVICE ALONE!!",yes,,,,
"sometimes the owner guy at the register might be a little rude but i think it might be a ""cultural misunderstanding.""  he just has this grievous-looking face but i've only been here a few times so don't know if he normally smiles or not.  he did tell me to have a nice day after i got my food.TODAY:the owner did warn me it takes a long time for the salmon to cook; not because fish itself takes any longer than for chicken or steak to cook it's technically the fastest meat to cook but because their customers usually order chicken or steak before they would fish... so like 10 people got their orders BEFORE me even though i came before all of them.  so with my 30 minute lunch break i waited a whopping 25 minutes for the wrap.  get this when i got there there was only one other guy waiting for his food so i don't know what took my fish so long.  both times that i have been here i ordered the salmon pita wrap because i happened to be craving some grilled fish.  it's ok.. a little bland and they tend to drizzle the hot sauce which is not spicy at all onto the wrong places in the wrap.  there is always sauce dripping out of the pita and wrapper before i even get to take a bite.other than that i don't recommend this place because the food is kind of boring.  not flavorful like how i expect most middle eastern food would taste.  also this place is wicked expensive.  so i got a bottle of pepsi and a salmon wrap; the cost was close to $12.",yes,,,,
Absolutely stunning inside no doubt about it one of the most beautiful places in all the Boston bar/restaurant scene the space is artistic and exciting interesting yet soothing. Chic beyond belief and a martini menu to match but not the crowd to nor the bar staff.Bartender made us the wrong drink and only sort of offered to make us the right one but never did and still charged us for it.  --This is not a $7 martini either.  Crowd was rude and obnoxious as were the waitstaff.Just because you're gorgeous doesn't mean you can be so rude Banq.,no,,,,
after reading numerous reviews of this place i must admit i was a bit leery of coming here for food.  ever since i had introduced my friend to the gorgeous space and we would wander by in the south end we would loiter around outside staring in through the windows like charlie in the candy store but we never had the opportunity to dine at this establishment.  however a couple of my friends and i decided to make a date of it for brunch.  once inside the tiny non-descript door beneath the historic canopy the interiors were as theatrical as they looked outside.  the space is designed and built by local architects officedA of which i am a big fan.  they are also known for creating the majestic interiors of mantra in downtown crossing.  the extruded wood pieces that create the inundating ceiling [as if you were in the rib cage of a vastly deformed whale] subdued the noise that would potentially be in such a space without carpeting or wall coverings.  the tables were seated far apart to induce private conversations without the fear or discomfort of being overheard.  great for private people who don't venture from their homes.and alas the food was great!  maybe you can't really screw up brunch that badly but the small menu featured classics such as eggs benedict with a few twists to it.  there were three different types of eggs benedict:  the classic ham the salmon and the salmon with rock shrimp.  we ventured forth with the salmon with rock shrimp which is also accompanied with wasabi butter if you choose.  despite my lack of having a sweet tooth i was also enamored by the banq classic french toast with lavender honey.  nevertheless their bloody marys could use a little improvement.at a place like this dining here is not complete without a visit to the facilities.  unlike places like 28 degrees the bathrooms were a bit bland.  nice but the attention was definitely lavished upon the outside dining space.  what a concept!,yes,,,,
"RUDE!Attempted brunch there today after contemplating the many choices in the area and decided to give it a try.Place had at most a half dozen people seated in there and waitress took us right away and seated us all the way in back. The ""bench"" on the wall that I was sitting on was very uncomfortable for my back. I simply requested if we might be able to be seated at one of the many other tables with chairs that were free. Waitress needed to get permission first and upon doing so came back to us to say it was OK to move to another assigned table. As my friend and I were getting up to move the lovely hostess walked over and questioned "" so what do guys have big plans to spread out"" implying our need for the table which happen to seat four. I explained the bench was very uncomfortable and we were told to move to this other table. At this point having to explain this twice almost apologizing asking not to sit on what amounts to wooden sticks then being rudely questioned by the head hostess left me just wanting to rush out of there.Place was not busy maybe 6 patrons in the whole restaurant  they should have been happy to accommodate us. There are plenty of choices out there and paying premium prices for eggs and bread with all the attitude isn't going to work in their favor. Get a grip your on centre st. in JP!   Hostess needs to be grateful people are walking in and try to make their experience a pleasant one and not one to make a person want to leave. Went to Ulas instead had a great brunch less than half the price and actual smiles from the help!",no,,,,
Good place for takeout or dining.  Fish quality is solid.  Never been wowed by the rolls or nigiri but never had a bad experience either.  Perfectly good place for utility sushi.  Good lunch specials and timely service.,yes,,,,
Huge disappointment - I stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago ..I wanted to grab a burger to go .. The person at the count was very nice and helpful ... I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich .... I waited at the counter .... as I stood and waited I saw two guys walk in the restaurant and and then go behind the counter ... they were welcomed by the guy making my sandwich ... they were hi - fiving and hugging and chatting ... then the guy started making my sandwich ... the guys just stood there still talking and laughing ... what the hell ... he is making my sandwich with bare hands that he just was hi - fiving and whatnot with these people that just walked in off the street ... god only knows what made it into my sandwich .... I took it and left ... I should have refused to buy it ... I threw it away and plan to never return ... gross I will never return to this disgusting establishment ... they should get a visit from the health dept.,no,,,,
Love the salsa and the tacos. Their tostada's are great at well. The food is super fresh!,yes,,,,
Clean pleasant music but not blaring very pleasant friendly staff  and that is before the food. Get the tongue tacos and Burria on weekends. Homemade drinks are great pineapple or tamarind.,yes,,,,
Forest Hills Pizza love of my life fire of my loins! Seriously I love this place. The family who owns it are amazingly friendly people. They knew me as a Forest Hills resident poor college student who bought pizza from them almost every night. Tragically the restaurant was struck by a fire in 2007 only to be rebuilt and better than ever in 2008. I cannot tell you how I rejoiced when I heard the news. They smile everytime I come in the door ask how I am and thank me generously when I stand on my tip-toes to put dollars in their tip jar.You can pick up a small pizza fit for one for around 5 bucks a little extra if you desire toppings. The grilled chicken salad with pita bread is amazing and healthy too. They give you tons of fresh veggies again for around $5! The chicken is marinated and grilled and helps make a healthy dinner a little less boring. The chicken sandwich is also noteworthy. When in Forest Hills Cemetery Franklin Park the Arboretum stop by Forest Hills Pizza and sit on the rainbow cafeteria style booths and share a basket of fries with someone you love.,yes,,,,
Wisteria has really good Taiwanese food. very tasty. However the smoothies they have on the menu- none of the employees seem to know how to make.  I saw them tasting while making it with a spoon right out of the blender and reuse the same unwashed spoon to try again later.  It's so unsanitary one guy even scooped out another spoonful to give his coworker to try. Just gross.. I immediately asked for my money back. Such a shame.. bc their food does taste good.,no,,,,
This place is bright and new and clean - and yet another addition to my neighborhood. Keep them coming! I had a bagel with cream cheese and a bottled water - there wasn't much they had to do to it. The man had their home made iced tea and an egg sandwich. Although the sandwich was pressed nicely and the cheese was melty they forgot his bacon. I had ordered it to go so by the time we realized this it was too late. He enjoyed the sandwich but would have preferred it with bacon.The menu appears to be simple yet effective soups salads sandwiches breakfast sandwiches and pastries etc.. And the best news is that they deliver until 8pm. We haven't tried that yet but it's nice to know it's an option. Oh and it's in the McAllen building which is G-R-E-E-N as is environmentally conscious not the color.,yes,,,,
Just moved to South Boston a couple weeks ago and I have finally found a place in the neighborhood that is: - meticulously clean...the minimal design aids this effort - large communal and small private table - free wi-fi - good coffees and tea - take credit cards - vegan / vegetarian foodSophia's is a wonderful compliment to the beautiful Macallen building...now I got to convince them to stay open late for a couple nights per week and to get a liquor license.,yes,,,,
I love the chocolate scones. MMMMM.While the prices for some things are a bit steep.. the ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. The owners are super friendly and accomodating. The tables are always washed down and the place is always clean. Its such a conveinient location across from the T.. its a good option to Dunkin Donuts before the morning commute.,yes,,,,
Delicious food that is consistently fresh and appealing.  Their cinnamon chip scones are the best I've ever had and their lattes are soothing and tasty.  Turkey or ham sandwiches practically overflow: they really do not skimp on the meat.  Also the raw snowballs almonds dates coconut flakes and a host of other tasty things are absolutely delicious.  Very friendly service very clean place and the free WiFi is definitely a bonus.Knocking off a star for two reasons: first is that some of their servers are really slow when preparing sandwiches.  Better than they used to be a few months ago though I've noted!  The other is that it seems to lack personality.  I'm the kind of gal who likes texture color comfort in her surroundings, the contemporary white and bamboo and lots of white walls aren't my thing.Overall though definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.  I'm really glad they're here.,yes,,,

I love this place!! It replaced Christopher's Cafe which had it's own charm good cookies and coffee but wasn't exactly clean... but I digress Anyway the only downside is the hours. They are open 8-3 Mon-Fri.. 10-3 Saturday and closed Sunday.The food is great.  Gourmet soups creative sandwiches and comfortable favorites The Meltdown ... 3 kinds of cheese melted on texas toast.  The bagels are big soft and tasty.  Coffee is good and strong.  Try the muffins... whether you get the tiny muffin for 50 cents or the large muffin for $1  you'll be pleased! they have a website www.eatatblunch.com Check it out.,yes,,,,
"do not fear ""blunch"" because of its terrible name. embrace it cause it's delicious!i get the feeling this place is a true labor of love - the woman working when i visited was i think the owner? when my boyfriend was sad that the sandwich he wanted to order was sold out she offered to make him up something special instead! how nice is that?the veg options are somewhat limited. there's a vegetable sandwich a grilled cheese the meltdown and a new veggie burger. my grilled cheese was delicious. there was probably an entire block of cheese in there but whatevs it was delicious. my boyfriend had the big papi and he LOVED it. the place is really cute and clean inside. i look forward to visiting again  and trying a whole wheat bagel sandwich!",yes,,,,
Awesome.  I just had the Tea Sandwhich: chicken breast boursin cheese cucumbers tomatoes greens lemon aioli on a panini.  Only way it could have been better was if I saw that it was available on the wrap.Great friendly service and the place is super clean and happy inside.  Small but that's a good way to chat up your  neighbor.,yes,,,,
"I went to Boston for the first time this Spring Break and this was our first stop. Well technically Dunkin' was my first stop but that was a tragedy I shall not elaborate on.  We had arrived too late to go to Mike and Patty's but Yelp informed us that Blunch was pretty similar since we were in the mood for sandwiches.The store itself is very quaint. Kind of small with only a handful of seats at a window-side counter and a small table. It was no problem finding a seat because we were there around 2PM but I can see how seating could be a problem during prime eating time. Definitely not a place to bring parties exceeding three or four unless you take out.Quite the variety on the menu including a daily Soup and Sandwich whim. When we asked the manager for a recommendation she replied ""That's like asking me to choose between my own children!"". Personally I don't see how that's a problem because my parents would totally choose me hands down.  My sister and I ended up choosing The Piglet because we are huge fans of bacon. The maple aioli really made the sandwich. Mm. We also bought the chocolate chip cookies that previous Yelp reviews have been raving over. Not over-hyped that was a crack cookie yes indeed. Crunchy on the outside soft gooey and chewy in the center even after we had left it sitting for an hour as we devoured our sandwiches. Rating Breakdown:2/2 stars for Taste - Delicious original and clean!1/1 star for Value - I don't usually venture outside my $5 footlong budget but at ~$7 a sandwich definitely worth it.1/1 Star for Customer Service - The manager was both helpful friendly. When she saw that my sister and I were sharing a sandwich she even cut it in half and served them on separate plates.And finally one bonus star because if I ever go back to Boston I would definitely come again.",yes,,,,
Picked up a nice bagel loaded with cold smoked salmon capers tomatoes aioli. Nicely toasted large plain bagel thin slices of salmon covering both halves. Nice presentation of the two halves covered in aioli and a dollop of some type of cream cheese. Nice menu of choices and the place seemed very comfortable though very few tables and clean. Will definitely come back maybe for a lunch sandwich from my workplace across the street at Boston Medical Center,yes,,,,
Great little spot a little hard to find. Tried smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel. Delicious! Been a few times and everything was A+. Chocolate chip cookies are warm and tasty!,yes,,,,
This place is worth the walk. I can say that because I walked 1.8 miles to get to this place. It was all those great photos on yelp that did it for me. This place is close to a hospital and easily missed. It's kinda of like a lower level apartment  apartment.  When you walk in it's warm and inviting.  The people who work there are so happy are at least that is what they project. I had the turkey bagel sandwich. I added Boursin because they made it there. Yep you guessed right it was scrumptious. I wished I would have found this place sooner. The sandwich was a great size they caliche their own turkey and with a smile. My dude had the blt and the bacon did not disappoint. The thickness was perfect and it was not to salty.  When I make my health trip to Boston this place is a must stop.  Oh and those cookies just say eat me!! They are a lovely bunch of calories on your tummy.,yes,,,,
Blunch finds a way to pack four eggs worth of well egg in to a $5 breakfast sandwich. Give it up for casserole bakes!Herbed flavorful and fluffy the ova brick you'll find wedged between two halves of a tender grain-forward hard roll is more than substantial. For another buck and change you can bring the meat sliced ham bacon or sausage and you should definitely make it spicy - the house made spread is mayo based and pleasantly piquant in its heat.The breakfast menu is fairly limited with Egg and Bagelwiches dominating the morning board. You'll find a few pastries - scones muffins croissants and the like - along with a cooler of juices and a selection of hot dranks. The lunch stuff had me drooling/bookmarking a return visit for the midday. Expect to grab and go though as the counter stools fill quickly.The kicker? Fun little supporting efforts for local non-profits. Stuff a buck in to the water donation bucket for animal welfare or a bring a pair of socks for the homeless. Resulting warm fuzzies no charge.,no,,,,
Very good sushi - great location - great atmosphere.  I will return!,yes,,,,
Felt so sick after eating a couple pieces of tuna which were not cold and fresh but warm and mushy... Disappointed,no,,,,
Tried this place again and was once again disappointed.  This was a Monday night at 9pm.  There were only about 6 tables eating but we had to flag our waitress down 3 different times with effort.  Actually after 15 minutes with our menus closed the other server volunteered to take our initial order.  The agedashi tofu was good but room temperature.  The lobster gyoza were very plain and lacked flavor.  Our special scallop entree was good but not warm enough.  In fact none of our dishes arrived hot.  Finally the special sushi roll was ok but not special and at $18 for the roll was far overpriced.  Disappointing overall.,no,,,,
The stars are for the Chicken which is pretty good and authentic.  As for the rest of the menu though...the sushi was small lukewarm and tasted a little bland.  The rice they used was also weird which messed up the taste of the sushi overall.  The water also tasted old...like it came from rusted pipes.My girlfriend and I were excited to try this place out but were sad to say very disappointed.,no,,,,
Who goes to a sushi restaurant and doesn't have sushi?I DO! I DO!But for no other reason than that I was not in the mood. I wanted something warm and with the slight hangover I had sushi just wasn't cutting it.The veggie dumpling appetizer was delicious brought quickly and followed by a steaming bowl of really good miso soup.For my entree I ordered Miso Salmon: an enormous serving piled high with veggies cooked just right and a small salad. Only weird thing: the cold salad came on the same plate as my hot dinner. But alas forgive and forget because the salmon was delicious and the portion so big I even took some home.My boyfriend' sister also recommends dropping by for some of their take-out sushi...lots of specialty rolls at decent prices and a great selection of raw and cooked choices.If Brighton was my 'hood I would definitely make this a regular spot!,yes,,,,
I had an immense fear of sushi until the hubz coerced me into trying it.  We started at a few other places further down Beacon St. that get all the hurrah and I was lukewarm to it at best.  Then along came Fins.  Yum and Yum.Highly recommend:Lobster roll - huge hunks of cooked lobster tops the roll underneath.Crazy maki - enough bite of fire maki topped with spicy tuna can you tell I like things plopped on top?Miso salmon - nicely cooked fish with a sweet tangWe've tried a bunch of others and always high quality great taste.  Fast delivery to boot as noted by previous posters.  Plus silver bullet sized Sapporos make it all that much better.,yes,,,,
"Friends and I were headed over to the Extreme Sailing Event across the street. So it happened to be a restaurant of convenience since it was a few steps away. I've had friends who have dined at Morton's before at other locations and raved about their food and service. We arrived at about 7pm got seated at the outside patio almost immediately which was the ONLY highlight of our dining experience. Once we were seated our waiter offered us the wine and diner menu. I expected him to have a sales pitch about which were favorites or the special of the evening but no he didn't instead he simply said ""we are out of the prime rib"" and gave us a whole 2 minutes to look over the menu. My partner ordered the porter house steak $56 and I ordered the Chilean Sea bass $45. Our other two friends ordered the rib eye and a salmon dish. We passed on alcoholic beverages as we had planned on going to Lucky's around the corner where they had live band and planned on getting our drinking on over there. So here we are waiting and getting all excited about yummy delicious food. Well shit an hour must have gone by before 3 of our dishes arrived. The waiter says the salmon dish is on its way and gave our friend his broccoli side order. Who the hell knew ""on its way"" meant a whole 30 minutes later? What the heck?! How are you going to bring out 3 dishes? You wanted us to eat steak and seafood in front of our friend who was starving and nibbling on his $13 broccoli?! You expected us to wait for him to get his main dish while ours got cold? That was plain bull shit service if you ask me. And to make it worse when it did arrive it looked like a log that had been burning for hours!!! Dude salmon even grilled should have some color in it. At this point I felt like we were being punked or had gone into some low end cheap restaurant. But trust me when we received our bill I know we were at Morton's which I expected anyways... no big deal. Our waiter came by maybe once to ask us if everything was okay. All in the meanwhile I noticed he serviced the other tables around us a whole lot more. Here's the funny part of the evening. When the waiter came to pick up our plates including my friends broccoli plate which I didn't think he was done with since it was still full and his salmon plate hasn't arrived yet. The waiter took it and I said ""Sir I'm not sure my friend is done with that yet"". He puts it back down. The friend had stepped to the mens room. I roll my eyes and say sarcastically to my other friend ""I swear I don't even feel like leaving tip with everything that has gone wrong thus far"". Little did I know my friend whom never ... ever listens to me.......leaves a 3 cent tip!!!! At first I was pretty mad about it since friends and I have always always left generous tips. My family owns a restaurant and I've waitressed before. But after thinking about it our waiter really really didn't deserve it. he never even apologized about how long the salmon took nor when he took the broccoli plate. And as far as the food goes it was good but I've been to other places a thousand times better and have paid more. Here's another funny thing I happen to have my camera with me. Since I've heard great things about Morton's steaks I decided to record my partner as he took his first bite into his steak. And trust me it wasn't the ""Oh my gawd its soo good"" look. It was more the shear look of utter disappointment. I will post that on my page later this evening. Thumbs down for sure and never again at least this location. I'd love to be able to send the manager there an email about how bad our server was but our server didn't even have a name tag and I forgot to ask.",no,,,,
"Theres just something about these really shitty sub-par restaurants bars and clubs in boston that try to mimic places like LA or Miami emphasis on try that really makes me cringe.Ive eaten at cafeteria...only delivery i will never eat in the restaurant due to the fact its filled with pretentious ""were cool because we spray champagne and buy magnum bottles in clubs"" partying wannabe college kid losers who go more for the  social status this shameful place somehow brings them rather than good food.Food is terribly inconsistent some days it tastes great other days it looks absolutely horrible and tastes revolting!! They clearly do not use the same head chef every day i presume.Absolutely nothing to write home about u want some good food theres plenty of other places in boston with amazing food and atmosphere.",no,,,,
This place is disgusting.The food is gross.The service is terrible.And it's WAY over priced!The only reason anyone eats here is because they're pretty much the only place open when the bars close. When I first moved to the area I used to think this place was great when I was shitfaced but after eating there  ONCE while sober I  would rather stay hungry until the morning!I see everyone else here pretty much feels the same way!,no,,,,
"This place fucking sucks. The pizza fucking sucks. I got a beef shawarma wrap too. It fucking sucked. That shit tasted like wet dog food not that i've ever eaten or will ever eat dog food but if I were to I imagine that's what it would taste like. Also the prices are much too expensive for the ""quality"" of food they serve. Plus the place is just plain dirty. Why I ate there i'll never know. I will never fucking eat there again. That place is....you know....I bet I bet if the health dept walked in there they would get shut down in about 5 seconds.I REALLY can't believe that there are NO OTHER PLACES OPEN AFTER THE BARS LET OUT in this area. I grew up in a town of just under 80000 people. There were TONS of places open 24 hours. What gives?Did my review sound a little angry? Sorry.......just a little worked up.... ::deep breath::",no,,,,
Oceanaire was wonderful, it was exactly in tune with my taste both food-wise and asthetically. With decor aimed at achieving the feel of a 1930's ocean liner the interior was every bit as rich and classy as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio led you to believe it was. The wine glasses were enormous as were the portions. Between my parents my brother and my boyfriend we sampled everything the restaurant week menu had to offer- end result? Fat and happy.Unfortunately this place is as pricey as a night at Ruth's Chris practicing the same meat/fish-comes-alone-and-each-side-costs-extra type of deal. We tried the sauteed garlic spinach yukon mashed potatoes and -per my adolescent request- salt and vinegar shoe-string fries. All delicious and all big enough to pass around the table.For dessert I had my tummy set on the banana-chocolate Baked Alaska, thus I forewent the pre-fixe items cheesecake key lime pie sorbets and indulged. Glad I did because the presentation flaming table-side and the taste a serious delight was incredible. And since my mom had brought my birthday presents early the dessert was comped without us even asking. Other fancy perks? An escort to the bathroom a valet/ waiting cab and my personal favorite- either a black or white napkin depending on what you are wearing in order to remain lint-free.,yes,,
Went to VeeVee for the first time on Friday evening.  I am a foodie but I found the menu very odd.  It's kind of expensive portions are small and tofu seems to be the only option on the menu for non-meat options.  The menu in general is sparse.  I had to really try to find something to order.The worst part is that so many items are deep fat fried.  The potato cakes were like eating greasy 'Tater Tots.  A lot of the flavor can be lost in veggie items that are heavy breaded and fried - kinda yucky.  The panna cotta for dessert was interesting but was barely set.  It's difficult to make a good panna cotta and to get the balance of the gelatin correct.  It just wasn't right somehow.I would not have gone to this restaurant if the others in my party hadn't selected it.  I am just not sure what the chef if trying to do with the menu.  I went away both wanting a burger and sort of not feeling well after all of the fried food.,no,,,,
This is where I have a brief moment of sanity at 6:30am, clean pleasant warm roomy creamy frothy caffeinated monopolized sanity with a  good soundtrack.I have switched to decaf sometimes as my middle school kids already give me that special kick in the morning. It's my overpriced gift to myself.  P.S. I   do refer to support small businesses when I can but I do need a quality cup of joe at this hour and with this conveinence...SO Starwhore on Huntington is very room and clean and the workers are really nice. Tip them.  They tend to play a lot of Nina Simone classical downbeat jazzy hip-hop and some nice ambient progressive electronic and more-- I ain't too proud to admit I like a lot of this Starwhore supported music!If I am desparate and need a lunch the turkey sandwitch is pretty good and it is only $35. I also have a fetish for their cheese plate that comes with many different kinds including brie fresh light bread with fruit in it and apples etc. Only $15.There is also yummy Coca-Cola-produced nutrient shakes and nasty robot-baked goods though the new berry Starwhore-shaped wheat muffin thing is salvagable--New at Star Whore!breakfast sandwitchs with re-heated fake egg fake sausage. It is kind of dry. Give me DD! The feta spinach fake egg on wheat wrap is pretty complicated for being bland. But I think it is a nutrition step up from the nearby BK breakfast sandwitch. At least I can get some protein in the morning even though it's kind of gross.StarWhore Newspaper highlighting an important current event!?

Goddamnit.  Methy Hobo beat me to the first review.The Old Stag List because I don't feel like writing complete sentences:- they do not have cider- they do have Mike's which is kinda gross- the bathroom is spectacularly awesomely nasty- and it's pretty clear people still smoke in it twinsets & pearls and/or pink hats probably shouldn't cross the Stag's threshold- no Clash on the jukebox- but it appears that they do have naked lady photo hunt- cheap- there is not an old stag head mounted anywhere- instead there is a black velvet painting of a deer- pool tables- damn strong gin & tonics- I was the only girl in the place besides the bartender for most of the night- Raucous pool tournaments every Monday night- founded in 1892 or some other date in the 1890s I admit I don't remember- spitting distance from my house- fun times,no,,,,
"Disgusting establishment. I speak for probably everyone who was there two weeks ago when their entire septic system was down. For 4 + hours they refused to allow people to use restrooms due to this issue. GUESS WHAT! That's illegal. The managers solution: ""you can go outside or to another bar"" to use a restroom. Good news is they gave us back our entry fee.Bad news is I got hit with the septic tube which was entering the building as I was leaving.  absolutely so gross.",no,,,,
"Should have read the reviews on this one first. I've got to make that more of a habit...Ordered from Allston Village tonight; mozzarella sticks roast beef club and a meatball sub. Delivery should be an hour sweet cool no prob.Hour and a half later I call back to ask if there's a problem. The guy says the driver already left it should be about ten minutes. I ask when the driver left; the guy says he's about to leave.Wait but you just said he already left?I ask the guy why they're running 30 minutes late. He says: ""So what? Why does it matter you should wait longer?""At which point I told him his customer service skills were terrible.Food gets here at the 2 hour mark and I'm just glad we actually got SOMETHING. The mozzarella sticks were fine but the bread for my club was not toasted it was STALE. Like solid-as-a-brick. My boyfriend's sub had weird ingredients and no cheese.This place is gross. Their food is gross. Their employees are gross. If it burns to the ground it would be a blessing to the foodie community.",no,,,,
"Overall I haven't found a single dimsum place in Boston that's comparable to the average dimsum you get in Hong Kong or even in San Francisco. Most of the places here serve pre-made dimsum in carts -- something you'll never see in Hong Kong today it's always freshly made-to-order there. So after learning that Winsor offers made-to-order dimsum I was doubly excited and decided to give Winsor a try. I was however incredibly disappointed. First the shrimps in both the ""ha gau"" shrimp dumplings and ""ha cheung"" shrimp rice rolls were completely overcooked. Since these were supposedly made-to-order I was expecting perfectly cooked shrimps -- crunchy firm and crisp. But these were the exact opposite. They were totally mushy. It almost seems as though they had been pre-cooked and were just re-steamed before serving. They did not taste fresh at all and were significantly worse than the shrimp dumplings at Hei La Moon and Chow Chow.Second the shrimps were not deveined at all. I had to use my finger to grab the veins out. After seeing all the gross black stuff stuck in my fingernails I was so grossed out I could barely eat the dumpling :  My boyfriend was so grossed out when he saw all the black stuff on my nails that he almost puked. I ate one piece and left all the rest in the basket. If you enjoy shrimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls go to Chow Chow instead. Theirs is the best with large perfectly cooked crunchy shrimps and delicious thick black sauce for the ""ha cheung"".Third the pork spareribs were not tender. The key to making great spareribs is to make sure that they are cut into small bite-sized pieces and to make sure that they achieve the right ""done-ness"" needed to break down the muscle fibers and connective tissues of the pork. Not only were the spareribs cut in chunks that were too big I could barely fit them in my mouth it seems they were also not cooked at the right temperature or were not cooked long enough. On top of that the black bean sauce was also not that tasty. If you like spareribs the pork spareribs at Hei La Moon tops the charts for me here in Boston.Fourth the siu mai shrimp and pork dumplings was totally dry and did not taste freshly made at all. If you are a siu mai fan go to Hei La Moon. They have the best siu mai in Chinatown.Fifth the siu long bao soup dumplings were a total disappointment too. The skin was way too thick and there was not enough soup inside the dumpling. Finally the kook fah or chrysanthemum tea was completely tasteless. Any respectable dim sum place should have at least decent tea. You can tell just by looking at its super pale color -- even without sipping it -- that it would be bland. The tea here is similar to the really ugly and cheap chrysanthemum tea that you get at Super 88. Both Hei La Moon and Chow Chow serve infinitely better chrysanthemum tea.If you are craving for dim sum go to Hei La Moon instead. Or Chow Chow. Sure they are nowhere near as good as the average dimsum places in Hong Kong or California but unfortunately these two are already the best Boston has to offer.",yes,,,,
The only reason I'm giving one star is because I couldn't give zero stars. Well I guess the Starbucks phone app is worth a star. I have learned that Starbucks in General has become like McDonalds. The only difference is that I actually have better things to say about McDonalds a place I rarely visit. I used to go to Starbucks religiously and thought it was the best. But then I went to some other coffee places and my thoughts on Starbucks changed. I order lattes in Starbucks and they usually taste blah. I would rather go to Whole Foods coffee bar or to the Thinking Cup to get a latte. The difference in taste is like night and day. One of my biggest issues with Starbucks is that they have poor training when it comes to cleanliness standards. Today I ordered a latte from the cambridge st location and the guy at the register grabbed my cup by the mouth where I'm going to be drinking from. His fingernails had some seriously visible dirt under them. Grossed me out. Why is he touching the mouth of my cup? Why not hold it from the bottom? This is actually a common practice at Starbucks with both the cashiers and the ppl making the drinks. Starbucks says that in the training that all of the baristas get they are specifically told not to handle the cup by the mouth. But for as many escalations as I've gone through at Starbucks the problem hasn't gone away. It makes the company look as though they don't give a crap. SMH. I'm not a cleanliness freak or anything but you guys should know how much stuff can be transmitted by ppl's hands touching the mouth of your cup if you choose to drink the drink without drinking from the lid Starbucks thinks that everyone drinks from the lid. Haha who wants to drink a latte from a lid??? This particular Starbucks location sucks a$$. It is small dingy dark and cut up into two sections because of a staircase that blocks it from being totally open. Definitely my least favorite Starbucks. The best one around here is the one at Charles and Beacon. The only time I go to Starbucks is if there's no other choice around. Lately though I've been finding myself walking 10 mins to go to Thinking Cup for a MUCH better experience.,no,,,,
"I'm not sure what's going on here...Come to East Ocean City and you'll find fairly standard Chinese food masquerading as high-end cuisine at least that's what the prices would have you believe.My party of five was mostly drawn in for the Lazy Susan-style dining and it was to be the only highlight of the meal I don't know what it is about turning a tray to bring food from one side of the table over to the other that excites me so much but feel free to analyze me if you'd like. Dishes ranged from pretty good tender barbecued boneless spareribs savory fried squid to meh uninspired szechuan spicy chicken crab rangoons chicken lo mein and rubbery steak with black pepper sauce to downright inedible seafood lai foon drenched in some heinous gelatinous substance inspiring the name ""bukkake noodles"" at my table.I suppose service was pretty good for Chinatown standards but I couldn't help but cringe when I saw the long dirty fingernails of the waiter who refilled my water and picked up my glass by the top. :O=",no,,,,
"As much as it pains me to give this place 2 stars because the food does taste delicious if I could give 1.5 I would I have to!  I simply have to.You would too if you saw someone come out of the kitchen plop in a seat across from your table and start clipping his fingernails and you suddenly start questioning every crunchy object in your dish for the rest of the meal.On another occasion since I was willing to give them another chance after the fingernail incident I was not just slightly but terribly aggravated to not only find a strange plastic like thing in my wonton soup in the first place but also to be told no it was not plastic but in fact part of the squid that they clean off and discard.  Well I don't care what it is WHY THE HELL IS IT IN MY SOUP?  I wanted to scream at everyone assuring me it wasn't plastic.  Ok it's not plastic.  Ok fine it's just the piece of the squid that you normally clean off and THROW AWAY in my soup which shouldn't be there in the first place but because you're telling me it's not plastic... suddenly having this rather large inedible piece of crap in my wonton soup is ok.  I was sooo frustrated and so sick of everyone spewing nonsense at me that if I didn't have a shred of decency a ""fuck you"" might have escaped my lips.  It didn't but after that I don't think I'll ever go back.",no,,,,
I went with high expectations. Odered NY sirloin medium came almost rare and cold. Also my friend's mushroom scrambled eggs came cold!!!!!The service amazingly slow and terrible I didn't get a steak knife asked for it and got it after 2 minutes while I was starring at my steak. The waiter's dirty fingernails did not make my appetite bigger just the opposite...Will never go back. He seemed more a contractor to me then a professional waiter. The only cool thing about them is their name. Never again.,no,,,,
"YUM!I came here for lunch with one of my friends.  We both work in Back Bay and were sick of eating at the Pru on the days we would meet up since is equidistant from each of our offices.  I was a little skeptical of the Thai/Viet dual menu but it was an unfounded fear.The menu is huge enough but they also have a lunch menu which was chock full of good choices.  I had gone in with the idea that I wanted pho but I saw a chow fun curry on the lunch menu.Let that one sink in...chow...fun...curry.Two of my most favorite things mixed together!  If I could eat chow fun noodles every day I would be...well fat for one thing but also happy.  I would gladly swim in a pool of chow fun noodles I love them so much.  Top that off with a spicy curry that made my nose run a little with tofu and veggies and I'm a happy camper.The service was also fast which was important for our lunch time constraints even though every table was taken.  Prices are very reasonable.My favorite thing was that as I was rushing down Comm Ave. back to my office I didn't feel like I had just eaten what my boss's husband calls a ""gut grenade"" - a heavy lump of nastiness that sits in your stomach like well a grenade.  Fresh and delicious and I will be back!",yes,,,,
You can find me here several times a month... I'm addicted to Pho Basil! Amazing food at a great price point especially the lunch special. Favorites: their pad thai and the crispy version are fantastic takes on a classic dish, the jungle curry will make your nose run due to spiciness but it's worth the tissues, beef thit lui is a delicious teriyaki appetizer, wild boar basil is spicy tastiness, and the tamarind duck is wonderfully crispy with an amazing sauce.Why yes I do come here a lot! The wait staff is always very kind although the restaurant gets pretty slammed during peak lunch and dinner hours and will take any special requests for your meal. The thai iced tea is quite good and the ambiance of the restaurant is very nice considering how cheap the food is. Great seasonal specials too! One of my regular haunts in the Boston area.,yes
Aside from the numerous establishments in Chinatown Pho Basil seems to offer one of the best combinations of tasty assorted asian dishes and low prices in Boston. It is the only asian restaurant in the Back Bay that I've gone to more than once. In fact I've probably eaten in or ordered take-out at least once a month since I discovered the place about a year ago.The menu offers a wide range of Thai and Vietnamese dishes with some items seemingly more Americanized than others. As far as I can tell the Vietnamese dishes are pretty authentic but regardless every dish I've ever had from here has been delicious. The dishes are always well spiced the veggies are cooked but not obliterated to mush the fried flat rice noodles are smokey and chewy in the best way and nothing has ever been particularly oily or goopy see bad pork lo mein or sesame chicken respectively although you can't actually order either here. I particularly like that when they say a dish is spicy or when you ask to make it extra spicy they really follow through which I guess is a warning to some diners and a bit of encouragement to others.Some personal favorites my GF and I get all the time:Kua Gai Noodle - Stir-fried flat rice noodle with chicken bean sprouts scallions egg ground peanuts lettuce crispy fried diced onions and cilantro. The lettuce sounds weird but honestly is amazing. It lightens the whole dish up and adds some great texture. This a good choice if spicy is not your thing. If spicy is your thing be sure to at least steal a bite from your scoville-shy date who orders this while you go for one of the dishes below.Drunken Noodle - Stir-fried flat rice noodles with mixed vegetables and egg in spicy basil sauce with your choice of meat/tofu. I get it with the tofu and it works great since the tofu really soaks up the delicious and rather spicy basil sauce.Wild Board Basil - Pork sauteed with pepper mushroom eggplant string bean green peppercorn pepper and basil leaves in white wine chili sauce. This is a dish that I've only ever seen at Pho Basil and is a must try if you like spice and pork. It's incredible. Ask them to make it extra spicy and you will be in nose-running eye-watering juicy pork heaven.Anything with basil sauce... really anything. Crispy chicken basil spicy tofu eggplant in basil sauce spicy basil w/meat or tofu etc. You get the idea.Anything with lemongrass grilled chicken especially the Bun Thit Nuong. The vietnamese dishes that offer a pile of veggies rice or noodles vinegary fish sauce and lemongrass chicken are very light and refreshing and the chicken is grilled perfectly. Dump that questionably odiferous but oh-so-delicious fish sauce over your entire plate and enjoy.Back to prices. For $8-10 bucks you can easily walk away with tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch in tow as the portion sizes are generous. If you sit in to eat you seem to get a bit more food but if you take it to go you can get away with a smaller tip and more efficient dinner run. You decide what you value more.Lastly the Thai iced tea is divine. Not for diabetics or lactase deficient individuals but I swear that thing is the tastiest caffeine and calorie delivery method known to man.,yes,,,,
"You ever walk pass a restaurant and just want to press your nose against the window to get a better look while you start daydreaming of an evening where you can enjoy yourself in such a lush environment?  So that was yours truly the first time I walk by this fantasy restaurant on my way to the movies.  *Sigh* If only I can be inside enjoying myself like those nicely dress people who seem to be ohhhing and ahhhing over their dishes.This past weekend I got my wish.  We arrived late for our reservation but the host and hostess were so courteous by not wanting to accept our apology as they graciously take our coats.  The interior was everything I had anticipated lavish open space with soft lightning so I can look my best and the volume was perfect so we can converse although the table next to us was a tad too close for comfort but we made do.Our server was attentive but she also didn't hover and was charismatic while educating us about the menu.  She served us a lobster coca consommé complimentary from the young 27-year-old chef I told you she educated us it was lovely and baffling.  It smells yummy and my mouth salivate at the smell of chocolate while my taste bud was overwhelmed by the lobster's strength not to mentioned utterly delighted.I enjoyed the Pollo E Pesce; again perplexed and charmed.  Raw yellowfin sashimi style pieces with chicken mayo and caper.  The BEST thing on the menu if you asked me.  The 2nd course of spaghetti alla carbonara was surprising light. Entrée was a sirloin steak served on top of braised beef cheek with a side of polenta.  I was never a fan of polenta/grits but these were the lightest polenta I have ever taste absolutely melts in your mouth that ""I can't believe it's not butter""!  Atlas our meal had to end for we were running behind but we did wash it all down with a very reasonably priced bottle of Presecco.  This place was a dream come true!",no,,,,

My friend went to a wedding reception here. It would have been a normal wedding party until she took the leftover dish from the party home and put it in her microwave. Not one or two but 4 little white worms came out of the stir fried vegetables. She took it back to the restaurant but the manager and the staff were so rude. They blamed it on the seafood and even dared her to call Health Department. She recorded the video of the worms crawling out of the veggies and posted it on Facebook. So just take a look. I also take a screenshot of the worms in the food and post it on here.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hei-la-moon-boston?select=xYMWvgL81o7kHAf3l1T19Q#xYMWvgL81o7kHAf3l1T19QYUCKY!

I come here often because it's one of the only places that are open at ungodly hours of the morning or should I say late night... 5:30AM? My erratic sleep cycles mean that I peak productivity before the crack of dawn. Yeah okay... let's not open that can of worms.Anyway the morning workers are actually quite pleasant. The counterwoman is always bright cheery and courteous. The food on the other hand is another story. If you're coming for a simple bagel and cream cheese you'll be fine. Not the greatest bagels nor schmears but not 'bad' per se. If you're coming for a breakfast sandwich sandwich or salad leave your expectations at the door. I've ordered the ham egg white and cheese on a whole wheat bagel on two different occasions. First time the lady didn't give me an egg white even though I reemphasized white three times. On both occasions the ham and egg were served COLD with the cheese not even melted. I think their oven isn't heating enough. Seriously it's disgusting eating ice cold ham and egg inside a breakfast sandwich. Not to mention all the potential food safety concerns associated with less than minimum heating temperatures. To make it all worse the disgusting egg patties tasted of cleaning products... detergents of some sort. Ugh. I almost wanted to puke at that point,no,,,,

I give this place a 4 because your delivery sucks and the people who answer your phone are deaf. Other than that when you actually get an order right your sushi is on target. Note to those of you who do not understand good sushi: The most important thing for good sushi is good RICE. This rice has a nice sweet and sour taste- mild of course and not at all soggy dry or sticky. This takes very accurate mixing of the vinegar into the rice after it is properly made in the giant rice cookers that every sushi place uses. It is not as easy as it seems. Some would say the FISH has to be great and most important for good sushi to thrive. No genius the fish is ALWAYS supposed to be top shelf when you are operating a sushi joint otherwise you are not only violating every health code on the continent you are also adding tape worms to people's stomachs. Although the amount of mercury in these fish how can anyone really complain. Just worry if you start to glow in the dark. Or your skin falls off.,no,,,,
Are you people kidding? I took a vegetarian friend from out of town to Grasshoppers last year. The place was inundated with cochroaches on the tables walls seats - and likely the food. The food was fine until we realized their were cochroaches everywhere. Then we left. Maybe it's under new management but I'd be really hard pressed to ever go back there. I'm not sure you're still a vegetarian if you eat bugs.,no,,,,
GREAT GREAT GREAT hot dogs!! they have any type of hot dogs that you would want and if they don't have it you can make it.. they have veggies fat free and combos.. they are the kings of hot dogs.. and if you get obsessed with them you can compete to see if you can eat more than 14 hot dogs..  go and enjoy..,yes,,,,
Food was good. Reasonable pricing. Everything went well until a cockroach appeared at our table.,no,,,,
WARNING:: COCKROACH ALERT I REPEAT COCKROACH ALERT!!!! I am NOT kidding!! Unfortunately we came across what later became dubbed as the break dancing cockroach at the end of our dinner. We were all waiting for our dessert to share fried banana in my opinion is just chicken fingers without the chicken-GROSS The waiter placed a stack of plates on the middle of the table and left I was passing each plate out and suddenly after the 4th plate or so this GIGANTIC cockroach was laying on it's back I didn't notice it until my friend screamed and started pointing! I looked down and the cockroach started flipping on the plate from holding onto its last seconds of life hence the break dancing cockroach. I jumped so far back! The waiter was right next to us taking another table's order and we interrupted uhh excuse me he saw the cockroach and quickly grabbed two plates using one to cover the plate with the cockroach on there to hide it and continued to take the other table's order!! And all this was just to add to the minuscule and bland entrees we ordered.,no,,,,
"I went today and ordered a won ton noodle soup.  All was fine until I came across the LARGE COCKROACH at the bottom of my bowl. I wish I were kidding about this. I pointed it out to my waiter who declared ""gross."" and took the bowl away. The hostess came over and said ""so sorry about that."" but did nothing else.  When they brought the check they didn't charge me for my cockroach soup but did charge my friend for his soup!  I will not be returning.  I wonder how many other people had cockroach soup today.",no,,,,
Unfortunately the first time I ate here I found one perfect reason to never come back. My coworker got to the bottom of their Chicken Pho soup and literally scooped out a cockroach. They gave him his food for free but the damage is already done.,no,,,,
I think the seafood at Giacomo's is very fresh and good and the prices are surprisingly reasonable for a North End establishment hence the 4 stars.However this place is overhyped. The giacomos sauce is good but kind of watery and runny. It is certainly not the best pasta dish I've ever had. I liked my meal because the seafood ingredients are good but there is nothing special about the execution of said ingredients.I stood in line once to get the experience but will not do that again. FYI the wait is about an hour on a Sunday afternoon at 4:20pm.,yes,,,,
We went to Modern after a really terrible dinner experience elsewhere in the North End. It was a holiday Monday so the lines were moderately long nothing like Mike's tho but it was definitely worth it in the end.The place is small and friendly, they are cash only which really isn't a problem considering the prices.We came here for the cannoli because we heard they fill them on the spot -- the ricotta filled ones were great, the pastry was perfect the cream was a bit runny but quite ok. We also ended up getting a fruit tart with the kiwis a paragina and half a dozen macaroons. We ate the cannoli at the fountains toward Haymarket and really enjoyed them. The rest of the pastries were consumed much later at home but they still tasted amazing. The TART was the best I ever had and I really am not too fond of gelatin. My boyfriend's paragina was also amazing and boozy or so he says. The macaroons were delicious and we got some with the crunchy flaky pine nuts. Finally a good pastry shop in Boston. Also our whole order 2 cannoli 1 tart 1 paragina 6 macaroons was $15. We almost fell over we expected $25 at least. Thank you Modern!,yes,,
The first time I tried to go to Mike's with some friends we didn't get in because the line was just too long and curving around the block. Yesterday however while waiting in line to get into a restaurant at the North End what's with North End restaurants and long lines we saw Mike's Pastry right across the street. Since it was 20 degrees and the boyfriend had agreed to hold our place in line for the restaurant my friend and I went across the street to Mike's. Lo and behold a huge selection of cannolis whoopie pies cakes all kinds of pastries... were on display behind glass. The line was not too bad moved fairly quickly. Tip is to just move to the line that looks the shortest. Initially I thought that seemed rude but after a while I think that's just the way to go! In any case we got the florentine and chocolate ricotta cannoli lobstertail and rum cake. I had the florentine and lobstertail in the shop with my friend and wow! Mike's pastries definitely live up to the hype! Amazingly crusty shell and fresh delicious cream in both the cannolo and lobstertail. The cream tastes fresh and was a good texture thick and not too runny just the right amount of sweetness. This morning I woke up and tried the lobstertail still as good as yesterday. The chocolate ricotta cannolo wasn't as good as the florentine I had yesterday. Maybe it was because the shell had become soft overnight? In any case would recommend eating your cannolis fresh next time! Rum cake is still sitting in its box since the boy is still sleeping. Hmm or maybe I should eat it and tell him it fell off the car yesterday?,yes,,,,
This place gets five stars because the lobster pasta I had a few weeks ago was probably the most delicious pasta I've ever tasted. I'm salivating at the thought of it!Two in my party had the white fish I believe halibut which was tasty but the flavors weren't nearly as rich as the pasta. If I return I will be sure to try the osso bucco--it looked amazing! It was getting rave reviews from our table neighbors. The service was great and the setting was what you'd expect of fine dining.I will happily return to Mamma Maria.,yes,,,,
