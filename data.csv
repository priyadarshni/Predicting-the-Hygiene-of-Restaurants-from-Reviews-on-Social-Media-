17,"Blue nile, Camp"," I seriously had high expectations from this place after reading its reviews. I ordered chicken seekh kebabs which were extreeemely dry,not spicy and just not good!!! I later ordered chicken kolhapuri hoping it to b good atleast but nope it wasn't that good. Later ordered murgh biryani which wasn't spicy,actually I'm disappointed. I paid for nothing! ",1,

20,"Blue nile, Camp",Chicken Biryani was amazing. Perfect flavour. Loved it. Chicken reshmi kebab was not great neither falooda ice cream. Ambience is nice. More suited for a family lunch or dinner. Service is quick. Recommended for Biryanis! ,3,
21,"Soul spice, Ambegaon",Need improvement in terms of infrastructure and cleanliness for the price they charge,2,
22,"Blue nile, Camp","My favourite is surely the roasted or tandoori pomfret, chicken tangdi kebab , biriyani and the caramel custard. A true landmark of the famous Iranian food culture of Pune.. a must visit if you are in Pune .. ",3,
23,"Blue nile, Camp",If you love Briyani and you are in Pune rush to this place now. Chicken or Mutton both of them are fabulous. I like the chicken biryani more of here.

28,"Blue nile, Camp"," One of the rustic old favourite restaurant in town. Service here is amazing. Ambiance is good but a bit noisy sometimes. You get a good feel here with some awesome food. Biryani here is out of the world, the meat melts in your mouth. Recommend for a lovely dinner. ",2,
29,"Blue nile, Camp",Its always a pleasure to visit this outlet in Camp Area. I prefer Chicken Biryani and Seafood Starters. Service is so fast and the staff is prompt in service. And all dishes are pocket friendly. ,3,
30,"Blue nile, Camp"," Rating it two for the dessert, ordered a flooda after lunch, the falooda was totally watery and had very less nuts, falooda etc. When we asked for cancellation the manager became a bit offensive and instead added a few spoons of falooda, but still let me tell you that’s not how a falooda is served. ",4,
31,"Aangan, Dhankawdi","amazing place. Amazing food. Amazing service.
But the sitting arrangement is very bad. Our table was just next to the loud speakers and it was horrifying!!!!
We couldn’t talk, couldn’t listen, neither place an order with waiter. We were about to faint because of the loud music and we waited for clock to Strike 12 so the music stops.",2,
32,"Aangan, Dhankawdi"," Amazing  place in Katraj . Live music is like cherry on the top.. I personally love this place for its food and ambience. 
Although in weekends it is bit crowdy. You might end up waiting for 40 mins but that's worth waiting",3,

quality of food needs improvement (atleast the veg dishes).
overall its a good place for students who don't drink :p
worth going atleast once",4,
34,"Aangan, Dhankawdi"," The most pocket friendly place in katraj area.
They have certainly enough varieties considering the price
The main catch is starters obviously, all tasty enough for your taste-buds 
Also desserts are really good.
 Service was prompt and better than others certainly ",6,

37,"Blue nile, Camp"," I ordered the chicken schezwan noodles. What I got had huge quantity of noodles with very little of chicken, sauce and everything else besides noodles. Imagine salted noodles with a few pieces of chicken here and a very far there, that's exactly what was served to me. ",3,
38,"Blue nile, Camp","the taste of the food was fine. I'm still not really happy with the quality of ingredients they use. I felt that they can improve on this. But something they really need to work on is Service. The staff I felt is not al all friendly. Whenever I visit the place, I always feel that they don't really value customers. ",5,
39,"Aangan, Dhankawdi",It was a horrible experience. We been waiting for nearly an hour for the table and even after we got the table service wasn't proper. Overall it was a waste of time. Food was okey but the place was not so clean and surrounding was noisy. ,6,

58,"R K Biryani House, Dhankawdi","To my rescue the biryani was good but too costly for the quantity served, also the rice wasn't complimenting well as it should have been served in dum style or the masala should have been more prominent. We also tried Chicken Tandoori which was freah, hot crispy and just right to fill your tummy with .",2,
59,"R K Biryani House, Dhankawdi","This place has three sections for dining. First floor is exclusively for family. Ground floor section has asbestos roofing and thereby lacks in ambiance.

Was here for a quick drink last night. I have been ordering Chicken Nanza till date and was completely happy with that. Until last night when I ordered “Sweet Chill Broccoli” and m in love with this dish. We had also ordered prawns but I dint even feel like touching those when I had broccoli. That was really amazing. 

I will soon be visiting 1000 Oaks for broccoli",2,
86,"oakwoods, Camp","Too quiet outside and too loud inside. Great ambience outdoors for date night or a family outing. Great ambience inside if you wanna get hmered and lose your hearing. Good energy, just way too extreme for my taste. Had the baby corn fries. They were good.",5,

89,"oakwoods, Camp",One of the oldest bars in pune located in the heart of pune. Service was very quick. Great music. The food here is amazing. The bar tends to get louder post 10:30 pm. Some nights they have live bands too. Prices are reasonable. The place was clean. The Indian food was amazing. Go to this place to chill with your friends and family.,2,
90,"oakwoods, Camp",They serve yummy food and the vibes are great. I have been celebrating my last 3 Christmas nights here and they never disappoint. A very good family and friends hangout where you would easily spot families and friends on adjacent tables. Keep it up,1,

96,"R K Biryani House, Dhankawdi","Biryani rice is heavily steamed cooked so it has lost the taste of it.......tambda rassa pandhra rassa are worse to taste as I have ever tasted it.

It's a fabulous place to hang out with friends. When I went it was retro night and people were dancing away their blues :) Being close to the camp area its frequented by a lot of army people and army kids. The coasters have funny messages on them...The food was great with a nice taste. The cocktail I ordered was particularly awesome. I still remember, their flavored beer in kingfisher glass, it was just wow. they are known for their Classic Oaks Barman's cocktail. Kerala food festival was on so tried Kerala version of roasted chicken with curry leaves. Both F&B were brilliant. The ambiance is also good. Both outdoor and indoor seating available. Overall not too high in the pocket also considering the tasty food on offer. Definitely worth a visit. Great place",2,

101,"R K Biryani House, Dhankawdi","I tried veg biryani which lacked flavor. The rice was long and somewhat thick which was certainly hard to swallow.

102,"oakwoods, Camp",Food is exorbitant(ly) costly for it's   quality and quantity.,3,
103,"oakwoods, Camp",Once famous for Paneer Nanza. Now they have compromised with its quality was well as quantity Disappointed!,2,
104,"oakwoods, Camp",The food quantity is too less. Prawns curry was very hot and spicy. Outdoor seating is noisy. The staff needs to be polite and quick. They had the most dirtiest baby high chair I had seen in any of the hotels till date. Still chicken Peri Peri is a must try,1,
105,"oakwoods, Camp",We went with family on Christmas night...ambience was good but the service was patetic...very very slow...they made us to wait around 15 min just for 1butter roti...you will be disappointed for quntity served...we ordered chicken sheek kebabsas starter's but the quantity in very small not enough for even single person,2,
106,"oakwoods, Camp","One of the most over hyped places in town. When we went there were hardly any table full only a couple of them. But they dint allow us to sit at the place of our choice, they put reserved on table only to remove  when a big group comes. they refused many people if they were in small group. even when we left the place still many people were waiting outside even when tables are empty. If it was us we would have gone to some other nearby place. the food is not that great here anyways.Even a woman was fighting with them about the table. We would not go there again.",3,

The chicken biryani is a tad bit spicy for my palate but I can't stop eating it, it's served with pandra rassa and tambra rassa, even the biryani rice they serve is immensely aromatic and tastes good. ",1,
